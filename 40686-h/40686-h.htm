weight.&rsquo; This was in one Alpine valley. Any one who has caught
but a glimpse of the world&rsquo;s Walpurgis Night, as revealed in
Mythology and Folklore, must agree that this courteous devil did not
overstate the case. Any attempt to catalogue the evil spectres which
have haunted mankind were like trying to count the shadows cast upon
the earth by the rising sun. This conviction has grown upon the author
of this work at every step in his studies of the subject.</p>
<p>In 1859 I contributed, as one of the American &lsquo;Tracts for the
Times,&rsquo; a pamphlet entitled &lsquo;The Natural History of the
Devil.&rsquo; Probably the chief value of that essay was to myself, and
this in that its preparation had revealed to me how pregnant with
interest and importance was the subject selected. Subsequent researches
in the same direction, after I had come to reside in Europe, revealed
how slight had been my conception of the vastness of the domain upon
which that early venture was made. In 1872, while preparing a series of
lectures for the Royal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e187" href=
"#xd20e187" name="xd20e187">vi</a>]</span>Institution on Demonology, it
appeared to me that the best I could do was to print those lectures
with some notes and additions; but after they were delivered there
still remained with me unused the greater part of materials collected
in many countries, and the phantasmal creatures which I had evoked
would not permit me to rest from my labours until I had dealt with them
more thoroughly.</p>
<p>The fable of Thor&rsquo;s attempt to drink up a small spring, and
his failure because it was fed by the ocean, seems aimed at such
efforts as mine. But there is another aspect of the case which has
yielded me more encouragement. These phantom hosts, however
unmanageable as to number, when closely examined, present comparatively
few types; they coalesce by hundreds; from being at first overwhelmed
by their multiplicity, the classifier finds himself at length beating
bushes to start a new variety. Around some single form&mdash;the
physiognomy, it may be, of Hunger or Disease, of Lust or
Cruelty&mdash;ignorant imagination has broken up nature into
innumerable bits which, like mirrors of various surface, reflect the
same in endless sizes and distortions; but they vanish if that central
fact be withdrawn.</p>
<p>In trying to conquer, as it were, these imaginary monsters, they
have sometimes swarmed and gibbered around me in a mad comedy which
travestied their tragic sway over those who believed in their reality.
Gargoyles extended their grin over the finest architecture, cornices
coiled to serpents, the very words of speakers started out of their
conventional sense into images that tripped my attention. Only as what
I believed right solutions were given to their problems were my
sphinxes laid; but through this psychological experience it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e193" href="#xd20e193" name=
"xd20e193">vii</a>]</span>appeared that when one was so laid his or her
legion disappeared also. Long ago such phantasms ceased to haunt my
nerves, because I discovered their unreality; I am now venturing to
believe that their mythologic forms cease to haunt my studies, because
I have found out their reality.</p>
<p>Why slay the slain? Such may be the question that will arise in the
minds of many who see this book. A Scotch song says, &lsquo;The Devil
is dead, and buried at Kirkcaldy;&rsquo; if so, he did not die until he
had created a world in his image. The natural world is overlaid by an
unnatural religion, breeding bitterness around simplest thoughts,
obstructions to science, estrangements not more reasonable than if they
resulted from varying notions of lunar figures,&mdash;all derived from
the Devil-bequeathed dogma that certain beliefs and disbeliefs are of
infernal instigation. Dogmas moulded in a fossil demonology make the
foundation of institutions which divert wealth, learning, enterprise,
to fictitious ends. It has not, therefore, been mere intellectual
curiosity which has kept me working at this subject these many years,
but an increasing conviction that the sequel&aelig; of such
superstitions are exercising a still formidable influence. When Father
Delaporte lately published his book on the Devil, his Bishop
wrote&mdash;&lsquo;Reverend Father, if every one busied himself with
the Devil as you do, the kingdom of God would gain by it.&rsquo;
Identifying the kingdom here spoken of as that of Truth, it has been
with a certain concurrence in the Bishop&rsquo;s sentiment that I have
busied myself with the work now given to the public. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A college in the State of Ohio has adopted for its
motto the words &lsquo;Orient thyself.&rsquo; This significant
admonition to Western youth represents one condition of attaining truth
in the science of mythology. Through neglect of it the glowing
personifications and metaphors of the East have too generally migrated
to the West only to find it a Medusa turning them to stone. Our prosaic
literalism changes their ideals to idols. The time has come when we
must learn rather to see ourselves in them: out of an age and
civilisation where we live in habitual recognition of natural forces we
may transport ourselves to a period and region where no sophisticated
eye looks upon nature. The sun is a chariot drawn by shining steeds and
driven by a refulgent deity; the stars ascend and move by arbitrary
power or command; the tree is the bower of a spirit; the fountain leaps
from the urn of a naiad. In such gay costumes did the laws of nature
hold <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb2" href="#v1pb2" name=
"v1pb2">2</a>]</span>their carnival until Science struck the hour for
unmasking. The costumes and masks have with us become materials for
studying the history of the human mind, but to know them we must
translate our senses back into that phase of our own early existence,
so far as is consistent with carrying our culture with us.</p>
<p>Without conceding too much to Solar mythology, it may be pronounced
tolerably clear that the earliest emotion of worship was born out of
the wonder with which man looked up to the heavens above him. The
splendours of the morning and evening; the azure vault, painted with
frescoes of cloud or blackened by the storm; the night, crowned with
constellations: these awakened imagination, inspired awe, kindled
admiration, and at length adoration, in the being who had reached
intervals in which his eye was lifted above the earth. Amid the rapture
of Vedic hymns to these sublimities we meet sharp questionings whether
there be any such gods as the priests say, and suspicion is sometimes
cast on sacrifices. The forms that peopled the celestial spaces may
have been those of ancestors, kings, and great men, but anterior to all
forms was the poetic enthusiasm which built heavenly mansions for them;
and the crude cosmogonies of primitive science were probably caught up
by this spirit, and consecrated as slowly as scientific generalisations
now are.</p>
<p>Our modern ideas of evolution might suggest the reverse of
this&mdash;that human worship began with things low and gradually
ascended to high objects; that from rude ages, in which adoration was
directed to stock and stone, tree and reptile, the human mind climbed
by degrees to the contemplation and reverence of celestial grandeurs.
But the accord of this view with our ideas of evolution is apparent
only. The real progress seems here to have been from the far to the
near, from the great to the small. It <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb3" href="#v1pb3" name="v1pb3">3</a>]</span>is, indeed, probably
inexact to speak of the worship of stock and stone, weed and wort,
insect and reptile, as primitive. There are many indications that such
things were by no race considered intrinsically sacred, nor were they
really worshipped until the origin of their sanctity was lost; and even
now, ages after their oracular or symbolical character has been
forgotten, the superstitions that have survived in connection with such
insignificant objects point to an original association with the
phenomena of the heavens. No religions could, at first glance, seem
wider apart than the worship of the serpent and that of the glorious
sun; yet many ancient temples are covered with symbols combining sun
and snake, and no form is more familiar in Egypt than the solar serpent
standing erect upon its tail, with rays around its head.</p>
<p>Nor is this high relationship of the adored reptile found only in
regions where it might have been raised up by ethnical combinations as
the mere survival of a savage symbol. William Craft, an African who
resided for some time in the kingdom of Dahomey, informed me of the
following incident which he had witnessed there. The sacred serpents
are kept in a grand house, which they sometimes leave to crawl in their
neighbouring grounds. One day a negro from some distant region
encountered one of these animals and killed it. The people learning
that one of their gods had been slain, seized the stranger, and having
surrounded him with a circle of brushwood, set it on fire. The poor
wretch broke through the circle of fire and ran, pursued by the crowd,
who struck him with heavy sticks. Smarting from the flames and blows,
he rushed into a river; but no sooner had he entered there than the
pursuit ceased, and he was told that, having gone through fire and
water, he was purified, and might emerge with safety. Thus, even in
that distant and savage <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb4" href=
"#v1pb4" name="v1pb4">4</a>]</span>region, serpent-worship was
associated with fire-worship and river-worship, which have a wide
representation in both Aryan and Semitic symbolism. To this day the
orthodox Israelites set beside their dead, before burial, the lighted
candle and a basin of pure water. These have been associated in
rabbinical mythology with the angels Michael (genius of Water) and
Gabriel (genius of Fire); but they refer both to the phenomenal glories
and the purifying effects of the two elements as reverenced by the
Africans in one direction and the Parsees in another.</p>
<p>Not less significant are the facts which were attested at the
witch-trials. It was shown that for their pretended divinations they
used plants&mdash;as rue and vervain&mdash;well known in the ancient
Northern religions, and often recognised as examples of tree-worship;
but it also appeared that around the cauldron a mock zodiacal circle
was drawn, and that every herb employed was alleged to have derived its
potency from having been gathered at a certain hour of the night or
day, a particular quarter of the moon, or from some spot where sun or
moon did or did not shine upon it. Ancient planet-worship is, indeed,
still reflected in the habit of village herbalists, who gather their
simples at certain phases of the moon, or at certain of those holy
periods of the year which conform more or less to the pre-christian
festivals.</p>
<p>These are a few out of many indications that the small and senseless
things which have become almost or quite fetishes were by no means such
at first, but were mystically connected with the heavenly elements and
splendours, like the animal forms in the zodiac. In one of the earliest
hymns of the Rig-Veda it is said&mdash;&lsquo;This earth belongs to
Varuna (<span class="trans" title="Ouranos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&Omicron;&#8016;&rho;&alpha;&nu;&#8057;&sigmaf;</span></span>) the
king, and the wide sky: he is contained also in this drop of
water.&rsquo; As the sky was seen reflected in the shining curve of a
dew-drop, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb5" href="#v1pb5" name=
"v1pb5">5</a>]</span>even so in the shape or colour of a leaf or
flower, the transformation of a chrysalis, or the burial and
resurrection of a scarab&aelig;us&rsquo; egg, some sign could be
detected making it answer in place of the typical image which could not
yet be painted or carved.</p>
<p>The necessities of expression would, of course, operate to invest
the primitive conceptions and interpretations of celestial phenomena
with those pictorial images drawn from earthly objects of which the
early languages are chiefly composed. In many cases that are met in the
most ancient hymns, the designations of exalted objects are so little
descriptive of them, that we may refer them to a period anterior to the
formation of that refined and complex symbolism by which primitive
religions have acquired a representation in definite characters. The
Vedic comparisons of the various colours of the dawn to horses, or the
rain-clouds to cows, denotes a much less mature development of thought
than the fine observation implied in the connection of the forked
lightning with the forked serpent-tongue and forked mistletoe, or
symbolisation of the universe in the concentric folds of an onion. It
is the presence of these more mystical and complex ideas in religions
which indicate a progress of the human mind from the large and obvious
to the more delicate and occult, and the growth of the higher vision
which can see small things in their large relationships. Although the
exaltation in the Vedas of Varuna as king of heaven, and as contained
also in a drop of water, is in one verse, we may well recognise an
immense distance in time between the two ideas there embodied. The
first represents that primitive pantheism which is the counterpart of
ignorance. An unclassified outward universe is the reflection of a mind
without form and void: it is while all within is as yet
undiscriminating wonder that the religious vesture of nature will be
this undefined pantheism. The fruit of the tree of the knowledge
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb6" href="#v1pb6" name=
"v1pb6">6</a>]</span>of good and evil has not yet been tasted. In some
of the earlier hymns of the Rig-Veda, the Maruts, the storm-deities,
are praised along with Indra, the sun; Yama, king of Death, is equally
adored with the goddess of Dawn. &lsquo;No real foe of yours is known
in heaven, nor in earth.&rsquo; &lsquo;The storms are thy
allies.&rsquo; Such is the high optimism of sentences found even in
sacred books which elsewhere mask the dawn of the Dualism which
ultimately superseded the harmony of the elemental Powers. &lsquo;I
create light and I create darkness, I create good and I create
evil.&rsquo; &lsquo;Look unto Yezdan, who causeth the shadow to
fall.&rsquo; But it is easy to see what must be the result when this
happy family of sun-god and storm-god and fire-god, and their
innumerable co-ordinate divinities, shall be divided by discord. When
each shall have become associated with some earthly object or fact, he
or she will appear as friend or foe, and their connection with the
sources of human pleasure and pain will be reflected in collisions and
wars in the heavens. The rebel clouds will be transformed to Titans and
Dragons. The adored Maruts will be no longer storm-heroes with
unsheathed swords of lightning, marching as the retinue of Indra, but
fire-breathing monsters&mdash;Vritras and Ahis,&mdash;and the morning
and evening shadows from faithful watch-dogs become the treacherous
hell-hounds, like Orthros and Cerberus. The vehement antagonisms
between animals and men and of tribe against tribe, will be expressed
in the conception of struggles among gods, who will thus be classified
as good or evil deities.</p>
<p>This was precisely what did occur. The primitive pantheism was
broken up: in its place the later ages beheld the universe as the arena
of a tremendous conflict between good and evil Powers, who severally,
in the process of time, marshalled each and everything, from a world to
a worm, under their flaming banners. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first pantheon of each race was built of
intellectual speculations. In a moral sense, each form in it might be
described as more or less demonic; and, indeed, it may almost be
affirmed that religion, considered as a service rendered to superhuman
beings, began with the propitiation of demons, albeit they might be
called gods. Man found that in the earth good things came with
difficulty, while thorns and weeds sprang up everywhere. The evil
powers seemed to be the strongest. The best deity had a touch of the
demon in him. The sun is the most beneficent, yet he bears the
sunstroke along with the sunbeam, and withers the blooms he calls
forth. The splendour, the might, the majesty, the menace, the grandeur
and wrath of the heavens and the elements were blended in these
personifications, and reflected in the trembling adoration paid to
them. The flattering names given to these powers by their worshippers
must be interpreted by the costly sacrifices with which men sought to
propitiate them. No sacrifice would have been offered originally to a
purely benevolent power. The Furies were called the Eumenides,
&lsquo;the well-meaning,&rsquo; and there arises a temptation to regard
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb8" href="#v1pb8" name=
"v1pb8">8</a>]</span>the name as preserving the primitive meaning of
the Sanskrit original of <span class="corr" id="xd20e1666" title=
"Source: Erinys">Erinyes</span>, namely, <i>Saranyu</i>, which
signifies the morning light stealing over the sky. But the descriptions
of the Erinyes by the Greek poets&mdash;especially of &AElig;schylus,
who pictures them as black, serpent-locked, with eyes dropping blood,
and calls them hounds&mdash;show that <i>Saranyu</i> as morning light,
and thus the revealer of deeds of darkness, had gradually been degraded
into a personification of the Curse. And yet, while recognising the
name Eumenides as euphemistic, we may admire none the less the growth
of that rationalism which ultimately found in the epithet a suggestion
of the soul of good in things evil, and almost restored the beneficent
sense of Saranyu. &lsquo;I have settled in this place,&rsquo; says
Athene in the &lsquo;Eumenides&rsquo; of &AElig;schylus, &lsquo;these
mighty deities, hard to be appeased; they have obtained by lot to
administer all things concerning men. But he who has not found them
gentle knows not whence come the ills of life.&rsquo; But before the
dread Erinyes of Homer&rsquo;s age had become the &lsquo;venerable
goddesses&rsquo; (<span class="trans" title="semnai theai"><span class=
"Greek" lang="el">&sigma;&epsilon;&mu;&nu;&alpha;&#8054;
&theta;&epsilon;&alpha;&#8054;</span></span>) of popular phrase in
Athens, or the Eumenides of the later poet&rsquo;s high insight,
piercing their Gorgon form as portrayed by himself, they had passed
through all the phases of human terror. Cowering generations had tried
to soothe the remorseless avengers by complimentary phrases. The
worship of the serpent, originating in the same fear, similarly raised
that animal into the region where poets could invest it with many
profound and beautiful significances. But these more distinctly
terrible deities are found in the shadowy border-land of mythology,
from which we may look back into ages when the fear in which worship is
born had not yet been separated into its elements of awe and
admiration, nor the heaven of supreme forces divided into ranks of
benevolent and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb9" href="#v1pb9" name=
"v1pb9">9</a>]</span>malevolent beings; and, on the other hand, we may
look forward to the ages in which the moral consciousness of man begins
to form the distinctions between good and evil, right and wrong, which
changes cosmogony into religion, and impresses every deity of the
mind&rsquo;s creation to do his or her part in reflecting the physical
and moral struggles of mankind.</p>

</div>
<p>The intermediate processes by which the good and evil were detached,
and advanced to separate personification, cannot always be traced, but
the indications of their work are in most cases sufficiently clear. The
relationship, for instance, between Baal and Baal-zebub cannot be
doubted. The one represents the Sun in his glory as quickener of Nature
and painter of its beauty, the other the insect-breeding power of the
Sun. Baal-zebub is the Fly-god. Only at a comparatively recent period
did the deity of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb10" href="#v1pb10"
name="v1pb10">10</a>]</span>the Philistines, whose oracle was consulted
by Ahaziah (2 Kings i.), suffer under the reputation of being
&lsquo;the Prince of Devils,&rsquo; his name being changed by a mere
pun to Beelzebul (dung-god). It is not impossible that the modern
Egyptian mother&rsquo;s hesitation to disturb flies settling on her
sleeping child, and the sanctity attributed to various insects,
originated in the awe felt for him. The title Fly-god is parallelled by
the reverent epithet <span class="trans" title="apomuios"><span class=

protecting charm, and evidently by the god&rsquo;s believers. There is
a story of a peasant woman in a French church who was found kneeling
before a marble group, and was warned by a priest that she was
worshipping the wrong figure&mdash;namely, Beelzebub. &lsquo;Never
mind,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;it is well enough to have friends on
both sides.&rsquo; The story, though now only <i>ben trovato</i>, would
represent the actual state of mind in many a Babylonian invoking the
protection of the Fly-god against formidable swarms of his venomous
subjects.</p>
<p>Not less clear is the illustration supplied by Scandinavian
mythology. In S&aelig;mund&rsquo;s Edda the evil-minded Loki
says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="line">Odin! dost thou remember</p>
<p class="line">When we in early days</p>

</div>
<p class="first">The two became detached very slowly; for their
separation implied the crumbling away of a great religion, and its
distribution into new forms; and a religion requires, relatively, as
long to decay as it does to grow, as we who live under a crumbling
religion have good reason to know. Protap Chunder Mozoomdar, of the
Brahmo-Somaj, in an address in London, said, &lsquo;The Indian Pantheon
has <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb11" href="#v1pb11" name=
"v1pb11">11</a>]</span>many millions of deities, and no space is left
for the Devil.&rsquo; He might have added that these deities have
distributed between them all the work that the Devil could perform if
he were admitted. His remark recalled to me the Eddaic story of
Loki&rsquo;s entrance into the assembly of gods in the halls of Oegir.
Loki&mdash;destined in a later age to be identified with Satan&mdash;is
angrily received by the deities, but he goes round and mentions
incidents in the life of each one which show them to be little if any
better than himself. The gods and goddesses, unable to reply, confirm
the cynic&rsquo;s criticisms in theologic fashion by tying him up with
a serpent for cord.</p>
<p>The late Theodore Parker is said to have replied to a Calvinist who
sought to convert him&mdash;&lsquo;The difference between us is simple:
your god is my devil.&rsquo; There can be little question that the
Hebrews, from whom the Calvinist inherited his deity, had no devil in
their mythology, because the jealous and vindictive Jehovah was quite
equal to any work of that kind,&mdash;as the hardening of
Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, bringing plagues upon the land, or deceiving a
prophet and then destroying him for his false prophecies.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1743src" href="#xd20e1743" name="xd20e1743src">4</a>
The same accommodating relation of the primitive deities to all natural
phenomena will account for the absence of distinct representatives of
evil of the most primitive religions.</p>
<p>The earliest exceptions to this primeval harmony of the gods,
implying moral chaos in man, were trifling enough: the occasional
monster seems worthy of mention only to display the valour of the god
who slew him. But such were demon-germs, born out of the structural
action of the human mind so soon as it began to form some philosophy
concerning a universe upon which it had at first looked with simple
wonder, and destined to an evolution of vast <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb12" href="#v1pb12" name=
"v1pb12">12</a>]</span>import when the work of moralising upon them
should follow.</p>
<p>Let us take our stand beside our barbarian, but no longer savage,
ancestor in the far past. We have watched the rosy morning as it waxed
to a blazing noon: then swiftly the sun is blotted out, the tempest
rages, it is a sudden night lit only by the forked lightning that
strikes tree, house, man, with angry thunder-peal. From an instructed
age man can look upon the storm blackening the sky not as an enemy of
the sun, but one of its own superlative effects; but some thousands of
years ago, when we were all living in Eastern barbarism, we could not
conceive that a luminary whose very business it was to give light,
could be a party to his own obscuration. We then looked with pity upon
the ignorance of our ancestors, who had sung hymns to the
storm-dragons, hoping to flatter them into quietness; and we came by
irresistible logic to that Dualism which long divided the visible, and
still divides the moral, universe into two hostile camps.</p>
<p>This is the mother-principle out of which demons (in the ordinary
sense of the term) proceeded. At first few, as distinguished from the
host of deities by exceptional harmfulness, they were multiplied with
man&rsquo;s growth in the classification of his world. Their principle
of existence is capable of indefinite expansion, until it shall include
all the realms of darkness, fear, and pain. In the names of demons, and
in the fables concerning them, the struggles of man in his ages of
weakness with peril, want, and death, are recorded more fully than in
any inscriptions on stone. Dualism is a creed which all superficial
appearances attest. Side by side the desert and the fruitful land, the
sunshine and the frost, sorrow and joy, life and death, sit weaving
around every life its vesture of bright and sombre threads, and Science
alone can detect how each of these <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb13" href="#v1pb13" name="v1pb13">13</a>]</span>casts the shuttle
to the other. Enemies to each other they will appear in every realm
which knowledge has not mastered. There is a refrain, gathered from
many ages, in William Blake&rsquo;s apostrophe to the tiger:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Tiger! tiger! burning bright</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">That which one of the devoutest men of genius whom
England has produced thus asked was silently answered in India by the
serpent-worshipper kneeling with his tongue held in his hand; in Egypt,
by Osiris seated on a throne of chequer.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>It is necessary to distinguish clearly between the Demon and the
Devil, though, for some purposes, they must be mentioned together. The
world was haunted with demons for many ages before there was any
embodiment of their spirit in any central form, much less any
conception of a Principle of Evil in the universe. The early demons had
no moral character, not any more than the man-eating tiger. There is no
outburst of moral indignation mingling with the shout of victory when
Indra slays Vritra, and Apollo&rsquo;s face is serene when his dart
pierces the Python. It required a much higher development of the moral
sentiment to give rise to the conception of a devil. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb14" href="#v1pb14" name=
"v1pb14">14</a>]</span>Only that intensest light could cast so black a
shadow athwart the world as the belief in a purely malignant spirit. To
such a conception&mdash;love of evil for its own sake&mdash;the word
Devil is limited in this work; Demon is applied to beings whose
harmfulness is not gratuitous, but incidental to their own
satisfactions.</p>
<p>Deity and Demon are <span class="corr" id="xd20e1798" title=
"Source: forms of the same word">from words once
interchangeable</span>, and the latter has simply suffered degradation
by the conventional use of it to designate the less beneficent powers
and qualities, which originally inhered in every deity, after they were
detached from these and separately personified. Every bright god had
his shadow, so to say; and under the influence of Dualism this shadow
attained a distinct existence and personality in the popular
imagination. The principle having once been established, that what
seemed beneficent and what seemed the reverse must be ascribed to
different powers, it is obvious that the evolution of demons must be
continuous, and their distribution co-extensive with the ills that
flesh is heir to. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb15" href="#v1pb15"

names&mdash;Legends of their fall&mdash;Incidental signs of the divine
origin of demons and devils.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The atmospheric conditions having been prepared in the
human mind for the production of demons, the particular shapes or names
they would assume would be determined by a variety of circumstances,
ethnical, climatic, political, or even accidental. They would, indeed,
be rarely accidental; but Professor Max M&uuml;ller, in his notes to
the Rig-Veda, has called attention to a remarkable instance in which
the formation of an imposing mythological figure of this kind had its
name determined by what, in all probability, was an accident. There
appears in the earliest Vedic hymns the name of Aditi, as the holy
Mother of many gods, and thrice there is mentioned the female name
Diti. But there is reason to believe that Diti is a mere reflex of
Aditi, the <i>a</i> being dropped originally by a reciter&rsquo;s
license. The later reciters, however, regarding every letter in so
sacred a book, or even the omission of a letter, as of eternal
significance, Diti&mdash;this decapitated Aditi&mdash;was evolved into
a separate and powerful being, and, every niche of beneficence being
occupied by its god or goddess, the new form was at once relegated to
the newly-defined realm of evil, where she remained as the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb16" href="#v1pb16" name=
"v1pb16">16</a>]</span>mother of the enemies of the gods, the Daityas.
Unhappily this accident followed the ancient tendency by which the
Furies and Vices have, with scandalous constancy, been described in the
feminine gender.</p>
<p>The close resemblance between these two names of Hindu mythology,
severally representing the best and the worst, may be thus accidental,
and only serve to show how the demon-forming tendency, after it began,
was able to press even the most trivial incidents into its service. But
generally the names of demons, and for whole races of demons, report
far more than this; and in no inquiry more than that before us is it
necessary to remember that names are things. The philological facts
supply a remarkable confirmation of the statements already made as to
the original identity of demon and deity. The word &lsquo;demon&rsquo;
itself, as we have said, originally bore a good instead of an evil
meaning. The Sanskrit <i>deva</i>, &lsquo;the shining one,&rsquo; Zend
<i>da&ecirc;va</i>, correspond with the Greek <span class="trans"
title="theos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>, Latin <i lang=
"la">deus</i>, Anglo-Saxon <i>Tiw</i>; and remain in
&lsquo;deity,&rsquo; &lsquo;deuce&rsquo; (probably; it exists in
Armorican, <i>teuz</i>, a phantom), &lsquo;devel&rsquo; (the gipsy name
for God), and <span class="corr" id="xd20e1844" title=
"Source: in &lsquo;demon.&rsquo;">Persian <i>d&#299;v,</i>
demon.</span> The Demon of Socrates represents the personification of a
being still good, but no doubt on the path of decline from pure
divinity. Plato declares that good men when they die become
&lsquo;demons,&rsquo; and he says &lsquo;demons are reporters and
carriers between gods and men.&rsquo; Our familiar word <i>bogey</i>, a
sort of nickname for an evil spirit, comes from the Slavonic word for
God&mdash;<i>bog</i>. Appearing here in the West as bogey (Welsh
<i>bwg</i>, a goblin), this word <i>bog</i> began, probably, as the
&lsquo;Baga&rsquo; of cuneiform inscriptions, a name of the Supreme
Being, or possibly the Hindu &lsquo;Bhaga,&rsquo; Lord of Life. In the
&lsquo;Bishop&rsquo;s Bible&rsquo; the passage occurs, &lsquo;Thou
shalt not be afraid of any <i>bugs</i> by night:&rsquo; the word has
been altered to &lsquo;terror.&rsquo; When we come to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb17" href="#v1pb17" name=
"v1pb17">17</a>]</span>the particular names of demons, we find many of
them bearing traces of the splendours from which they have declined.
&lsquo;Siva,&rsquo; the Hindu god of destruction, has a meaning
(&lsquo;auspicious&rsquo;) derived from <i>Sv&#299;,</i>
&lsquo;thrive&rsquo;&mdash;thus related ideally to Pluto,
&lsquo;wealth&rsquo;&mdash;and, indeed, in later ages, appears to have
gained the greatest elevation. In a story of the Persian poem Masnavi,
Ahriman is mentioned with Bahman as a fire-fiend, of which class are
the Magian demons and the Jinns generally; which, the sanctity of fire
being considered, is an evidence of their high origin. Avicenna says
that the genii are ethereal animals.
Lucifer&mdash;light-bearing&mdash;is the fallen angel of the morning
star. Loki&mdash;the nearest to an evil power of the Scandinavian
personifications&mdash;is the German <i lang="de">leucht</i>, or light.
Azazel&mdash;a word inaccurately rendered &lsquo;scape-goat&rsquo; in
the Bible&mdash;appears to have been originally a deity, as the
Israelites were originally required to offer up one goat to Jehovah and
another to Azazel, a name which appears to signify the &lsquo;strength
of God.&rsquo; Gesenius and Ewald regard Azazel as a demon belonging to
the pre-Mosaic religion, but it can hardly be doubted that the four
arch-demons mentioned by the Rabbins&mdash;Sama&euml;l, Azazel,
Asa&euml;l, and Maccathiel&mdash;are personifications of the elements
as energies of the deity. Sama&euml;l would appear to mean the
&lsquo;left hand of God;&rsquo; Azazel, his strength; Asa&euml;l, his
reproductive force; and Maccathiel, his retributive power<span class=
"corr" id="xd20e1874" title="Not in source">, but the origin of these
names is doubtful.</span>.</p>
<p>Although Azazel is now one of the Mussulman names for a devil, it
would appear to be nearly related to Al Uzza of the Koran, one of the
goddesses of whom the significant tradition exists, that once when
Mohammed had read, from the Sura called &lsquo;The Star,&rsquo; the
question, &lsquo;What think ye of Allat, Al Uzza, and Manah, that other
third goddess?&rsquo; he himself added, &lsquo;These are the most
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb18" href="#v1pb18" name=
"v1pb18">18</a>]</span>high and beauteous damsels, whose intercession
is to be hoped for,&rsquo; the response being afterwards attributed to
a suggestion of Satan.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1881src" href=
"#xd20e1881" name="xd20e1881src">1</a> Belial is merely a word for
godlessness; it has become personified through the misunderstanding of
the phrase in the Old Testament by the translators of the Septuagint,
and thus passed into christian use, as in 2 Cor. vi. 15, &lsquo;What
concord hath Christ with Belial?&rsquo; The word is not used as a
proper name in the Old Testament, and the late creation of a demon out
of it may be set down to accident.</p>
<p>Even where the names of demons and devils bear no such traces of
their degradation from the state of deities, there are apt to be
characteristics attributed to them, or myths connected with them, which
point in the direction indicated. Such is the case with Satan, of whom
much must be said hereafter, whose Hebrew name signifies the adversary,
but who, in the Book of Job, appears among the sons of God. The name
given to the devil in the Koran&mdash;Eblis&mdash;is almost certainly
<i>diabolos</i> Arabicised; and while this Greek word is found in
Pindar<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1889src" href="#xd20e1889" name=
"xd20e1889src">2</a> (5th century <span class="sc">B.C.</span>),
meaning a slanderer, the fables in the Koran concerning Eblis describe
him as a fallen angel of the highest rank.</p>
<p>One of the most striking indications of the fall of demons from
heaven is the wide-spread belief that they are lame. Mr. Tylor has
pointed out the curious persistence of this idea in various ethnical
lines of development.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1897src" href=
"#xd20e1897" name="xd20e1897src">3</a> Hephaistos was lamed by his fall
when hurled by Zeus from Olympos; and it is not a little singular that

"xd20e1900src">4</a> there should appear the suggestion, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb19" href="#v1pb19" name=

&lsquo;Vala&rsquo; (<span class="corr" id="xd20e1905" title=
"Source: seducer">coverer</span>), one of the designations of the
dragon destroyed by Indra. &lsquo;In Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s
romance,&rsquo; says Mr. Cox, &lsquo;Wayland is a mere impostor, who
avails himself of a popular superstition to keep up an air of mystery
about himself and his work, but the character to which he makes
pretence belongs to the genuine Teutonic legend.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1908src" href="#xd20e1908" name="xd20e1908src">5</a>
The Persian demon Aeshma&mdash;the Asmodeus of the Book of
Tobit&mdash;appears with the same characteristic of lameness in the
&lsquo;Diable Boiteux&rsquo; of Le Sage. The christian devil&rsquo;s
clubbed or cloven foot is notorious.</p>
<p>Even the horns popularly attributed to the devil may possibly have
originated with the aureole which indicates the glory of his
&lsquo;first estate.&rsquo; Satan is depicted in various relics of
early art wearing the aureole, as in a miniature of the tenth century
(from Bible No. 6, Bib. Roy.), given by M. Didron.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e1913src" href="#xd20e1913" name="xd20e1913src">6</a> The same
author has shown that Pan and the Satyrs, who had so much to do with
the shaping of our horned and hoofed devil, originally got their horns
from the same high source as Moses in the old Bibles,<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e1916src" href="#xd20e1916" name="xd20e1916src">7</a> and in
the great statue of him at Rome by Michel Angelo.</p>
<p>It is through this mythologic history that the most powerful demons
have been associated in the popular imagination with stars,
planets,&mdash;Ketu in India, Saturn and Mercury the
&lsquo;Infortunes,&rsquo;&mdash;comets, and other celestial phenomena.
The examples of this are so numerous that it is impossible to deal with
them here, where I can only hope to offer a few illustrations of the
principles affirmed; and in this case it is of less importance for the
English <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb20" href="#v1pb20" name=
"v1pb20">20</a>]</span>reader, because of the interesting volume in
which the subject has been specially dealt with.<a class="noteref" id=

Incidentally, too, the astrological demons and devils must recur from
time to time in the process of our inquiry. But it will probably be
within the knowledge of some of my readers that the dread of comets and
of meteoric showers yet lingers in many parts of Christendom, and that
fear of unlucky stars has not passed away with astrologers. There is a
Scottish legend told by Hugh Miller of an avenging meteoric demon. A
shipmaster who had moored his vessel near Morial&rsquo;s Den, amused
himself by watching the lights of the scattered farmhouses. After all
the rest had gone out one light lingered for some time. When that light
too had disappeared, the shipmaster beheld a large meteor, which, with
a hissing noise, moved towards the cottage. A dog howled, an owl
whooped; but when the fire-ball had almost reached the roof, a cock
crew from within the cottage, and the meteor rose again. Thrice this
was repeated, the meteor at the third cock-crow ascending among the
stars. On the following day the shipmaster went on shore, purchased the
cock, and took it away with him. Returned from his voyage, he looked
for the cottage, and found nothing but a few blackened stones. Nearly
sixty years ago a human skeleton was found near the spot, doubled up as
if the body had been huddled into a hole: this revived the legend, and
probably added some of those traits which make it a true bit of mosaic
in the mythology of Astr&aelig;a.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1932src"
href="#xd20e1932" name="xd20e1932src">9</a></p>
<p>The fabled &lsquo;fall of Lucifer&rsquo; really signifies a process
similar to that which has been noticed in the case of Saranyu. The
morning star, like the morning light, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb21" href="#v1pb21" name="v1pb21">21</a>]</span>revealer of the
deeds of darkness, becomes an avenger, and by evolution an instigator
of the evil it originally disclosed and punished. It may be remarked
also that though we have inherited the phrase &lsquo;Demons of
Darkness,&rsquo; it was an ancient rabbinical belief that the demons
went abroad in darkness not only because it facilitated their attacks
on man, but because being of luminous forms, they could recognise each
other better with a background of darkness. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The phenomena of the transformation of deities into
demons meet the student of Demonology at every step. We shall have to
consider many examples of a kind similar to those which have been
mentioned in the preceding chapter; but it is necessary to present at
this stage of our inquiry a sufficient number of examples to establish
the fact that in every country forces have been at work to degrade the
primitive gods into types of evil, as preliminary to a consideration of
the nature of those forces.</p>
<p>We find the history of the phenomena suggested in the German word
for idol, <span lang="de">Abgott</span>&mdash;ex-god. Then we have
&lsquo;pagan,&rsquo; villager, and &lsquo;heathen,&rsquo; of the heath,
denoting those who stood by their old gods after others had transferred
their faith to the new. These words bring us to consider the influence
upon religious conceptions of the struggles which have occurred between
races and nations, and consequently between their religions. It must be
borne in mind that by the time any tribes had gathered to the
consistency of a nation, one of the strongest forces of its coherence
would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb23" href="#v1pb23" name=
"v1pb23">23</a>]</span>be its priesthood. So soon as it became a
general belief that there were in the universe good and evil Powers,
there must arise a popular demand for the means of obtaining their
favour; and this demand has never failed to obtain a supply of
priesthoods claiming to bind or influence the pr&aelig;ternatural
beings. These priesthoods represent the strongest motives and fears of
a people, and they were gradually intrenched in great institutions
involving powerful interests. Every invasion or collision or mingling
of races thus brought their respective religions into contact and
rivalry; and as no priesthood has been known to consent peaceably to
its own downfall and the degradation of its own deities, we need not
wonder that there have been perpetual wars for religious ascendency. It
is not unusual to hear sects among ourselves accusing each other of
idolatry. In earlier times the rule was for each religion to denounce
its opponent&rsquo;s gods as devils. Gregory the Great wrote to his
missionary in Britain, the Abbot Mellitus, second Bishop of Canterbury,
that &lsquo;whereas the people were accustomed to sacrifice many oxen
in honour of demons, let them celebrate a religious and solemn
festival, and not slay the animals to the devil (diabolo), but to be
eaten by themselves to the glory of God.&rsquo; Thus the devotion of
meats to those deities of our ancestors which the Pope pronounces
demons, which took place chiefly at Yule-tide, has survived in our more
comfortable Christmas banquets. This was the fate of all the deities
which Christianity undertook to suppress. But it had been the habit of
religions for many ages before. They never denied the actual existence
of the deities they were engaged in suppressing. That would have been
too great an outrage upon popular beliefs, and might have caused a
reaction; and, besides, each new religion had an interest of its own in
preserving the basis of belief in these invisible <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb24" href="#v1pb24" name=
"v1pb24">24</a>]</span>beings. Disbelief in the very existence of the
old gods might be followed by a sceptical spirit that might endanger
the new. So the propagandists maintained the existence of native gods,
but called them devils. Sometimes wars or intercourse between tribes
led to their fusion; the battle between opposing religions was drawn,
in which case there would be a compromise by which several deities of
different origin might continue together in the same race and receive
equal homage. The differing degrees of importance ascribed to the
separate persons of the Hindu triad in various localities of India,
suggest it as quite probable that Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva signalled in
their union the political unity of certain districts in that
country.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1963src" href="#xd20e1963" name=
"xd20e1963src">1</a> The blending of the names of Confucius and Buddha,
in many Chinese and Japanese temples, may show us an analogous process
now going on, and, indeed, the various ethnical ideas combined in the
christian Trinity render the fact stated one of easy interpretation.
But the religious difficulty was sometimes not susceptible of
compromise. The most powerful priesthood carried the day, and they used
every ingenuity to degrade the gods of their opponents. Agathodemons
were turned into kakodemons. The serpent, worshipped in many lands,
might be adopted as the support of sleeping Vishnu in India, might be
associated with the rainbow (&lsquo;the heavenly serpent&rsquo;)
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb25" href="#v1pb25" name=
"v1pb25">25</a>]</span>in Persia, but elsewhere was cursed as the very
genius of evil.</p>
<p>The operation of this force in the degradation of deities, is
particularly revealed in the Sacred Books of Persia. In that country
the great religions of the East would appear to have contended against
each other with especial fury, and their struggles were probably
instrumental in causing one or more of the early migrations into
Western Europe. The great celestial war between Ormuzd and
Ahriman&mdash;Light and Darkness&mdash;corresponded with a violent
theological conflict, one result of which is that the word <i>deva</i>,
meaning &lsquo;deity&rsquo; to Brahmans, means &lsquo;devil&rsquo; to
Parsees. The following extract from the Zend-Avesta will serve as an
example of the spirit in which the war was waged:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All your devas are only manifold children of the Evil
Mind&mdash;and the great one who worships the Saoma of lies and
deceits; besides the treacherous acts for which you are notorious
throughout the seven regions of the earth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have invented all the evil which men speak and do, which
is indeed pleasant to the Devas, but is devoid of all goodness, and
therefore perishes before the insight of the truth of the wise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thus you defraud men of their good minds and of their
immortality by your evil minds&mdash;as well through those of the Devas
as that of the Evil Spirit&mdash;through evil deeds and evil words,
whereby the power of liars grows.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1979src" href="#xd20e1979" name="xd20e1979src">2</a></p>
<p>That is to say&mdash;Ours is the true god: your god is a devil.</p>
<p>The Zoroastrian conversion of <i>deva</i> (deus) into <i>devil</i>
does not alone represent the work of this <i lang="la">odium
theologicum</i>. In the early hymns of India the appellation
<i>asuras</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb26" href="#v1pb26"
name="v1pb26">26</a>]</span>is given to the gods. Asura means a spirit.
But in the process of time <i>asura</i>, like d&aelig;mon, came to have
a sinister meaning: the gods were called <i>suras</i>, the demons
<i>asuras</i>, and these were said to contend together. But in Persia
the <i>asuras</i>&mdash;demonised in India&mdash;retained their
divinity, and gave the name <i>ahura</i> to the supreme deity, Ormuzd
(Ahura-mazda). On the other hand, as Mr. Muir supposes, <i>Varenya</i>,
applied to evil spirits of darkness in the Zendavesta, is cognate with
Varuna (Heaven); and the Vedic Indra, king of the gods&mdash;the
Sun&mdash;is named in the Zoroastrian religion as one of the chief
councillors of that Prince of Darkness.</p>
<p>But in every country conquered by a new religion, there will always
be found some, as we have seen, who will hold on to the old deity under
all his changed fortunes. These will be called &lsquo;bigots,&rsquo;
but still they will adhere to the ancient belief and practise the old
rites. Sometimes even after they have had to yield to the popular
terminology, and call the old god a devil, they will find some reason
for continuing the transmitted forms. It is probable that to this cause
was originally due the religions which have been developed into what is
now termed Devil-worship. The distinct and avowed worship of the evil
Power in preference to the good is a rather startling phenomenon when
presented baldly; as, for example, in a prayer of the Madagascans to
Nyang, author of evil, quoted by Dr. R&eacute;ville:&mdash;&lsquo;O
Zamhor! to thee we offer no prayers. The good god needs no asking. But
we must pray to Nyang. Nyang must be appeased. O Nyang, bad and strong
spirit, let not the thunder roar over our heads! Tell the sea to keep
within its bounds! Spare, O Nyang, the ripening fruit, and dry not up
the blossoming rice! Let not our women bring forth children on the
accursed days. Thou reignest, and this thou knowest, over the wicked;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb27" href="#v1pb27" name=
"v1pb27">27</a>]</span>and great is their number, O Nyang. Torment not,
then, any longer the good folk!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2024src" href="#xd20e2024" name="xd20e2024src">3</a></p>
<p>This is natural, and suggestive of the criminal under sentence of
death, who, when asked if he was not afraid to meet his God, replied,
&lsquo;Not in the least; it&rsquo;s that other party I&rsquo;m afraid
of.&rsquo; Yet it is hardly doubtful that the worship of Nyang began in
an era when he was by no means considered morally baser than Zamhor.
How the theory of Dualism, when attained, might produce the phenomenon
called Devil-worship, is illustrated in the case of the Yezedis, now so
notorious for that species of religion. Their theory is usually
supposed to be entirely represented by the expression uttered by one of
them, &lsquo;Will not Satan, then, reward the poor Izedis, who alone
have never spoken ill of him, and have suffered so much for
him?&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2029src" href="#xd20e2029" name=
"xd20e2029src">4</a> But these words are significant, no doubt, of the
underlying fact: they &lsquo;have never spoken ill of&rsquo; the Satan
they worship. The Mussulman calls the Yezedi a Satan-worshipper only as
the early Zoroastrian held the worshipper of a <i>deva</i> to be the
same. The chief object of worship among the Yezedis is the figure of
the bird <i>Taous</i>, a half-mythical peacock. Professor King of
Cambridge traces the <i>Taous</i> of this Assyrian sect to the
&ldquo;sacred bird called a ph&oelig;nix,&rdquo; whose picture, as seen
by Herodotus (ii. 73) in Egypt, is described by him as &lsquo;very like
an eagle in outline and in size, but with plumage partly gold-coloured,
partly crimson,&rsquo; and which was said to return to Heliopolis every
five hundred years, there to burn itself on the altar of the Sun, that
another might rise from its ashes.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2041src"
href="#xd20e2041" name="xd20e2041src">5</a> Now the name Yezedis is
simply Izeds, genii; and we are thus pointed to Arabia, where we find
the belief in genii <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb28" href=
"#v1pb28" name="v1pb28">28</a>]</span>is strongest, and also associated
with the mythical bird <i>Rokh</i> of its folklore. There we find
Mohammed rebuking the popular belief in a certain bird called
Ham&acirc;h, which was said to take form from the blood near the brain
of a dead person and fly away, to return, however, at the end of every
hundred years to visit that person&rsquo;s sepulchre. But this is by no
means Devil-worship, nor can we find any trace of that in the most
sacred scripture of the Yezedis, the &lsquo;Eulogy of Sheikh
Adi.&rsquo; This Sheikh inherited from his father, Moosafir, the
sanctity of an incarnation of the divine essence, of which he (Adi)
speaks as &lsquo;the All-merciful.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="first">The reverence shown in these sacred sentences for
Hebrew names and traditions&mdash;as of Adam in Paradise, Marah, and
the smitten rock&mdash;and for Ahmet (Mohammed), appears <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb29" href="#v1pb29" name="v1pb29">29</a>]</span>to
have had its only requital in the odious designation of the worshippers
of <i>Taous</i> as Devil-worshippers, a label which the Yezedis perhaps
accepted as the Wesleyans and Friends accepted such names as
&lsquo;Methodist&rsquo; and &lsquo;Quaker.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mohammed has expiated the many deities he degraded to devils by
being himself turned to an idol (mawmet), a term of contempt all the
more popular for its resemblance to &lsquo;mummery.&rsquo; Despite his
denunciations of idolatry, it is certain that this earlier religion
represented by the Yezedis has never been entirely suppressed even
among his own followers. In Dr. Leitner&rsquo;s interesting collection
there is a lamp, which he obtained from a mosque, made in the shape of
a peacock, and this is but one of many similar relics of primitive or
alien symbolism found among the Mussulman tribes.</p>

<p>The evolution of demons and devils out of deities was made real to
the popular imagination in every country where the new religion found
art existing, and by alliance with it was enabled to shape the ideas of
the people. The theoretical degradation of deities of previously fair
association could only be completed where they were presented to the
eye in repulsive forms. It will readily occur to every one that a
rationally conceived demon or devil would not be repulsive. If it were
a demon that man wished to represent, mere euphemism would prevent its
being rendered odious. The main characteristic of a demon&mdash;that
which distinguishes it from a devil&mdash;is, as we have seen, that it
has a real and human-like motive for whatever evil it causes. If it
afflict or consume man, it is not from mere malignancy, but because
impelled by the pangs of hunger, lust, or other suffering, like the
famished wolf or shark. And if sacrifices of food were offered to
satisfy its need, equally we might expect that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb30" href="#v1pb30" name="v1pb30">30</a>]</span>no
unnecessary insult would be offered in the attempt to portray it. But
if it were a devil&mdash;a being actuated by simple
malevolence&mdash;one of its essential functions, temptation, would be
destroyed by hideousness. For the work of seduction we might expect a
devil to wear the form of an angel of light, but by no means to
approach his intended victim in any horrible shape, such as would repel
every mortal. The great representations of evil, whether imagined by
the speculative or the religious sense, have never been, originally,
ugly. The gods might be described as falling swiftly like lightning out
of heaven, but in the popular imagination they retained for a long time
much of their splendour. The very ingenuity with which they were
afterwards invested with ugliness in religious art, attests that there
were certain popular sentiments about them which had to be distinctly
reversed. It was because they were thought beautiful that they must be
painted ugly; it was because they were&mdash;even among converts to the
new religion&mdash;still secretly believed to be kind and helpful, that
there was employed such elaboration of hideous designs to deform them.
The pictorial representations of demons and devils will come under a
more detailed examination hereafter: it is for the present sufficient
to point out that the traditional blackness or ugliness of demons and
devils, as now thought of, by no means militates against the fact that
they were once the popular deities. The contrast, for instance, between
the horrible physiognomy given to Satan in ordinary christian art, and
the theological representation of him as the Tempter, is obvious. Had
the design of Art been to represent the theological theory, Satan would
have been portrayed in a fascinating form. But the design was not that;
it was to arouse horror and antipathy for the native deities to which
the ignorant clung tenaciously. It was to train <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb31" href="#v1pb31" name=
"v1pb31">31</a>]</span>children to think of the still
secretly-worshipped idols as frightful and bestial beings. It is
important, therefore, that we should guard against confusing the
speculative or moral attempts of mankind to personify pain and evil
with the ugly and brutal demons and devils of artificial superstition,
oftenest pictured on church walls. Sometimes they are set to support
water-spouts, often the brackets that hold their foes, the saints. It
is a very ancient device. Our figure 2 is from the handle of a chalice
in possession of Sir James Hooker, meant probably to hold the holy
water of Ganges. These are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb32" href=
"#v1pb32" name="v1pb32">32</a>]</span>not genuine demons or devils, but
carefully caricatured deities. Who that looks upon the grinning bestial
forms carved about the roof of any old church&mdash;as those on Melrose
Abbey and York Cathedral<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2113src" href=
"#xd20e2113" name="xd20e2113src">7</a>&mdash;which, there is reason to
believe, represent the primitive deities driven from the interior by
potency of holy water, and chained to the uncongenial service of
supporting the roof-gutter&mdash;can see in these gargoyles (Fr.
<i>gargouille</i>, dragon), anything but carved imprecations? Was it to
such ugly beings, guardians of their streams, hills, and forests, that
our ancestors consecrated the holly and mistletoe, or with such that
they associated their flowers, fruits, and homes? They were caricatures
inspired by missionaries, made to repel and disgust, as the images of
saints beside them were carved in beauty to attract. If the pagans had
been the artists, the good looks would have been on the other side. And
indeed there was an art of which those pagans were the unconscious
possessors, through which the true characters of the imaginary beings
they adored have been transmitted to us. In the fables of their
folklore we find the Fairies that represent the spirit of the gods and
goddesses to which they are easily traceable. That goddess who in
christian times was pictured as a hag riding on a broom-stick was
Frigga, the Earth-mother, associated with the first sacred affections
clustering around the hearth; or Freya, whose very name was consecrated
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb33" href="#v1pb33" name=
"v1pb33">33</a>]</span>in <i>frau</i>, woman and wife. The mantle of
Bertha did not cover more tenderness when it fell to the shoulders of
Mary. The German child&rsquo;s name for the pre-christian Madonna was
Mother Rose: distaff in hand, she watched over the industrious at their
household work: she hovered near the cottage, perhaps to find there
some weeping Cinderella and give her beauty for ashes. <span class=

&lsquo;Any Orientalist will appreciate the wonderful hotchpot of Hindu
and Arabic language and religion in the following details, noted down
among rude tribes of the Malay Peninsula. We hear of Jin Bumi, the
earth-god (Arabic jin = demon, Sanskrit bh&uuml;mi = earth); incense is
burnt to Jewajewa (Sanskrit dewa = god), who intercedes with Pirman,
the supreme invisible deity above the sky (Brahma?); the Moslem Allah
T&aacute;ala, with his wife Nabi Mahamad (Prophet Mohammed), appear in
the Hinduised characters of creator and destroyer of all things; and
while the spirits worshipped in stones are called by the Hindu term of
&lsquo;dewa&rsquo; or deity, Moslem conversion has so far influenced
the mind of the stone-worshipper that he will give to his sacred
boulder the name of Prophet Mohammed.&rsquo;&mdash;Tylor&rsquo;s

plan of Gregory for the conversion of temples prevailed. &lsquo;The
temples of the idols in that nation,&rsquo; wrote the Pope,

<p class="first">The obstructions of man&mdash;The twelve chief

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The statements made concerning the fair names of the
chief demons and devils which have haunted the imagination of mankind,
heighten the contrast between their celestial origin and the functions
attributed to them in their degraded forms. The theory of Dualism,
representing a necessary stage in the mental development of every race,
called for a supply of demons, and the supply came from the innumerable
dethroned, outlawed, and fallen deities and angels which had followed
the subjugation of races and their religions. But though their
celestial origin might linger around them in some slight legend or
characteristic as well as in their names, the evil phenomenon to which
each was attached as an explanation assigned the real form and work
with which he or she was associated in popular superstition. We
therefore find in the demons in which men have believed a complete
catalogue of the obstacles with which they have had to contend in the
long struggle for existence. In the devils we discover equally the
history of the moral and religious struggles through which priesthoods
and churches have had to pass. And the relative extent of this or that
particular class of demons <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb35" href=
"#v1pb35" name="v1pb35">35</a>]</span>or devils, and the intensity of
belief in any class as shown in the number of survivals from it, will
be found to reflect pretty faithfully the degree to which the special
evil represented by it afflicted primitive man, as attested by other
branches of pre-historic investigation.</p>
<p>As to function, the demons we shall have to consider are those
representing&mdash;1. Hunger; 2. Excessive Heat; 3. Excessive Cold; 4.
Destructive elements and physical convulsions; 5. Destructive animals;
6. Human enemies; 7. The Barrenness of the Earth, as rock and desert;
8. Obstacles, as the river or mountain; 9. Illusion, seductive,
invisible, and mysterious agents, causing delusions; 10. Darkness
(especially when unusual), Dreams, Nightmare; 11. Disease; 12.
Death.</p>
<p>These classes are selected, in obedience to necessary limitations,
as representing the twelve chief labours of man which have given shape
to the majority of his haunting demons, as distinguished from his
devils. Of course all classifications of this character must be
understood as made for convenience, and the divisions are not to be too
sharply taken. What Plotinus said of the gods, that each contained all
the rest, is equally true of both demons and devils. The demons of
Hunger are closely related to the demons of Fire: Agni devoured his
parents (two sticks consumed by the flame they produce); and from them
we pass easily to elemental demons, like the lightning, or demons of
fever. And similarly we find a relationship between other destructive
forces. Nevertheless, the distinctions drawn are not fanciful, but
exist in clear and unmistakable beliefs as to the special dispositions
and employments of demons; and as we are not engaged in dealing with
natural phenomena, but with superstitions concerning them, the only
necessity of this classification is that it shall not be arbitrary, but
shall really simplify the immense <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb36"
href="#v1pb36" name="v1pb36">36</a>]</span>mass of facts which the
student of Demonology has to encounter.</p>
<p>But there are several points which require especial attention as
preliminary to a consideration of these various classes of demons.</p>
<p>First, it is to be borne in mind that a single demonic form will
often appear in various functions, and that these must not be confused.
The serpent may represent the lightning, or the coil of the whirlwind,
or fatal venom; the earthquake may represent a swallowing Hunger-demon,
or the rage of a chained giant. The separate functions must not be lost
sight of because sometimes traceable to a single form, nor their
practical character suffer disguise through their fair euphemistic or
mythological names.</p>
<p>Secondly, the same form appears repeatedly in a diabolic as well as
a demonic function, and here a clear distinction must be maintained in
the reader&rsquo;s mind. The distinction already taken between a demon
and a devil is not arbitrary: the word demon is related to deity; the
word devil, though sometimes connected with the Sanskrit <i>deva</i>,
has really no relation to it, but has a bad sense as
&lsquo;calumniator:&rsquo; but even if there were no such etymological
identity and difference, it would be necessary to distinguish such
widely separate offices as those representing the afflictive forces of
nature where attributed to humanly appreciable motives on the one hand,
and evils ascribed to pure malignancy or a principle of evil on the
other. The Devil may, indeed, represent a further evolution in the line
on which the Demon has appeared; Ahriman the Bad in conflict with
Ormuzd the Good may be a spiritualisation of the conflict between Light
and Darkness, Sun and Cloud, as represented in the Vedic Indra and
Vritra; but the two phases represent different classes of ideas, indeed
different worlds, and the apprehension <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb37" href="#v1pb37" name="v1pb37">37</a>]</span>of both requires
that they shall be carefully distinguished even when associated with
the same forms and names.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there is an important class of demons which the reader may
expect to find fully treated of in the part of my work more
particularly devoted to Demonology, which must be deferred, or further
traced in that portion relating to the Devil; they are forms which in
their original conception were largely beneficent, and have become of
evil repute mainly through the anathema of theology. The chequer-board
on which Osiris sat had its development in hosts of primitive shapes of
light opposing shapes of darkness. The evil of some of these is ideal;
others are morally amphibious: Teraphim, Lares, genii, were ancestors
of the guardian angels and patron saints of the present day; they were
oftenest in the shapes of dogs and cats and aged human ancestors,
supposed to keep watch and ward about the house, like the friendly
Domovoi respected in Russia; the evil disposition and harmfulness
ascribed to them are partly natural but partly also theological, and
due to the difficulty of superseding them with patron saints and
angels. The degradation of beneficent beings, already described in
relation to large demonic and diabolic forms, must be understood as
constantly acting in the smallest details of household superstition,
with what strange reaction and momentous result will appear when we
come to consider the phenomena of Witchcraft.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be remarked that the nature of our inquiry renders
the consideration of the origin of myths&mdash;whether
&lsquo;solar&rsquo; or other&mdash;of secondary importance. Such origin
it will be necessary to point out and discuss incidentally, but our
main point will always be the forms in which the myths have become
incarnate, and their modifications in various places and times, these
being the result <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb38" href="#v1pb38"
name="v1pb38">38</a>]</span>of those actual experiences with which
Demonology is chiefly concerned. A myth, as many able writers have
pointed out, is, in its origin, an explanation by the uncivilised mind
of some natural phenomenon&mdash;not an allegory, not an esoteric
conceit<span class="corr" id="xd20e2165" title="Not in source">.</span>
For this reason it possesses fluidity, and takes on manifold shapes.
The apparent sleep of the sun in winter may be represented in a vast
range of myths, from the Seven Sleepers to the Man in the Moon of our
nursery rhyme; but the variations all have relation to facts and
circumstances. Comparative Mythology is mainly concerned with the one
thread running through them, and binding them all to the original myth;
the task of Demonology is rather to discover the agencies which have
given their several shapes. If it be shown that Orthros and Cerberus
were primarily the morning and evening twilight or howling winds,
either interpretation is here secondary to their personification as
dogs. Demonology would ask, Why dogs? why not bulls? Its answer in each
case detaches from the anterior myth its mode, and shows this as the
determining force of further myths. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In every part of the earth man&rsquo;s first struggle
was for his daily food. With only a rude implement of stone or bone he
had to get fish from the sea, bird from the air, beast from the forest.
For ages, with such poor equipment, he had to wring a precarious
livelihood from nature. He saw, too, every living form around him
similarly trying to satisfy its hunger. There seemed to be a Spirit of
Hunger abroad. And, at the same time, there was such a resistance to
man&rsquo;s satisfaction of his need&mdash;the bird and fish so hard to
get, the stingy earth so ready to give him a stone when he asked for
bread&mdash;that he came to the conclusion that there must be invisible
voracious beings who wanted all good things for themselves. So the
ancient world was haunted by a vast brood of Hunger-demons. There is an
African tribe, the Karens, whose representation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb42" href="#v1pb42" name="v1pb42">42</a>]</span>of
the Devil (Kephn) is a huge stomach floating through the air; and this
repulsive image may be regarded as the type of nearly half the demons
which have haunted the human imagination. This, too, is the terrible
Miru, with her daughters and slave, haunting the South Sea Islander.
&lsquo;The esoteric doctrine of the priests was, that souls leave the
body ere breath has quite gone, and travel to the edge of a cliff
facing the setting sun (R&#257;). A large wave now approaches the base
of the cliff, and a gigantic <i>bua</i> tree, covered with fragrant
blossoms, springs up from Avaiki (nether world) to receive on its
far-reaching branches human spirits, who are mysteriously impelled to
cluster on its limbs. When at length the mystic tree is covered with
human spirits, it goes down with its living freight to the nether
world. Akaanga, the slave of fearful Miru, mistress of the invisible
world, infallibly catches all these unhappy spirits in his net and
laves them to and fro in a lake. In these waters the captive ghosts
exhaust themselves by wriggling about like fishes, in the vain hope of
escape. The net is pulled up, and the half-drowned spirits enter into
the presence of dread Miru, who is ugliness personified. The secret of
Miru&rsquo;s power over her intended victims is the &lsquo;kava&rsquo;
root (<i lang="la">Piper mythisticum</i>). A bowl of this drink is
prepared for each visitor to the shades by her four lovely daughters.
Stupefied with the draught, the unresisting victims are borne off to a
mighty oven and cooked. Miru, her peerless daughters, her dance-loving
son, and the attendants, subsist exclusively on human spirits decoyed
to the nether world and then cooked. The drinking-cups of Miru are the
skulls of her victims. She is called in song
&lsquo;Miru-the-ruddy,&rsquo; because her cheeks ever glow with the
heat of the oven where her captives are cooked. As the surest way to
Miru&rsquo;s oven is to die a natural death, one need not marvel that
the Rev. Mr. Gill, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb43" href="#v1pb43"
name="v1pb43">43</a>]</span>who made these statements before the
Anthropological Institute in London (February 8, 1876), had heard
&lsquo;many anecdotes of aged warriors, scarcely able to hold a spear,
insisting on being led to the field of battle in the hope of gaining
the house of the brave.&rsquo; As the South Sea paradise seems to
consist in an eternal war-dance, or, in one island, in an eternal
chewing of sugar-cane, it is not unlikely that the aged seek violent
death chiefly to avoid the oven. We have here a remarkable illustration
of the distinguishing characteristic of the demon. Fearful as Miru is,
it may be noted that there is not one gratuitous element of cruelty in
her procedure. On the contrary, she even provides her victims with an
an&aelig;sthetic draught. Her prey is simply netted, washed, and
cooked, as for man are his animal inferiors. In one of the islands
(Aitutaki), Miru is believed to resort to a device which is certainly
terrible&mdash;namely, the contrivance that each soul entering the
nether world shall drink a bowl of living centipedes; but this is
simply with the one end in view of appeasing her own pangs of hunger,
for the object and effect of the draught is to cause the souls to drown
themselves, it being apparently only after entire death that they can
be cooked and devoured by Miru and her household.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the islanders, Miru is limited in her tortures to a
transmundane sphere, and room is left for many a slip between her
dreadful cup and the human lip. The floating stomach Kephn is, however,
not other-worldly. We see, however, a softened form of him in some
other tribes. The Greenlanders, Finns, Laps, conceived the idea that
there is a large paunch-demon which people could invoke to go and suck
the cows or consume the herds of their enemies; and the Icelanders have
a superstition that some people can construct such a demon out of bones
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb44" href="#v1pb44" name=
"v1pb44">44</a>]</span>skins, and send him forth to transmute the milk
or flesh of cattle into a supply of flesh and blood. A form of this
kind is represented in the Japanese Kagura (<a href="#v1fig3">figure
3</a>), the favourite mask of January dancers and drum-beaters seeking
money. The Kagura is in precise contrast with the Pretas (Siam), which,
though twelve miles in height, are too thin to be seen, their mouths
being so small as to render it impossible to satisfy their fearful
hunger.</p>
<p>The pot-bellies given to demons in Travancore and other districts of
India, and the blood-sacrifices by which the natives propitiate
them&mdash;concerning which a missionary naively remarks, that even
these heathen recognise, though in corrupted form, &lsquo;the great
truth that without shedding of blood there is no remission of
sins&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2205src" href="#xd20e2205" name=
"xd20e2205src">1</a>&mdash;refer to the Hunger-demon. They are the
brood of Kali, girt round with human skulls.</p>

</div>
<p>The expedition which went out to India to observe the last solar
eclipse was incidentally the means of calling attention to a remarkable
survival of the Hunger-demon in connection with astronomic phenomena.
While the English observers were arranging their apparatus, the natives
prepared a pile of brushwood, and, so soon as the eclipse began, they
set fire to this pile and began to shout and yell as they danced around
it. Not less significant were the popular observances generally. There
was a semi-holiday in honour of the eclipse. The ghauts were crowded
with pious worshippers. No Hindu, it is thought, ought to do any work
whatever during an eclipse, and there <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb45" href="#v1pb45" name="v1pb45">45</a>]</span>was a general
tendency to prolong the holiday a little beyond the exact time when the
shadow disappears, and indeed to prolong it throughout the day. All
earthenware vessels used for cooking were broken, and all cooked food
in the houses at the time of the eclipse was thrown out. It is regarded
as a time of peculiar blessings if taken in the right way, and of dread
consequences to persons inclined to heterodoxy or neglect of the proper
observances. Between nine and ten in the evening two shocks of an
earthquake occurred, the latter a rather unpleasant one, shaking the
tables and doors in an uncomfortable fashion for several seconds. To
the natives it was no surprise&mdash;they believe firmly in the
connection of eclipses and earthquakes.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2219src" href="#xd20e2219" name="xd20e2219src">2</a></p>
<p>Especially notable is the breaking of their culinary utensils by the
Hindus during an eclipse. In Copenhagen there is a collection of the
votive weapons of ancient Norsemen, every one broken as it was offered
up to the god of their victory in token of good faith, lest they should
be suspected of any intention to use again what they had given away.
For the same reason the cup was offered&mdash;broken&mdash;with the
libation. The Northman felt himself in the presence of the J&ouml;tunn
(giants), whose name Grimm identifies as the Eaters. For the Hindu of
to-day the ceremonies appropriate at an eclipse, however important,
have probably as little rational meaning as the occasional Belfire that
lights up certain dark corners of Europe has for those who build it.
But the traditional observances have come up from the childhood of the
world, when the eclipse represented a demon devouring the sun, who was
to have his attention called by outcries and prayers to the fact that
if it was fire he needed there was plenty on earth; and if food, he
might have all in their houses, provided he would consent to satisfy
his appetite <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb46" href="#v1pb46" name=
"v1pb46">46</a>]</span>with articles of food less important than the
luminaries of heaven.</p>
<p>Such is the shape now taken in India of the ancient myth of the
eclipse. When at the churning of the ocean to find the nectar of
immortality, a demon with dragon-tail was tasting that nectar, the sun
and moon told on him, but not until his head had become immortal; and
it is this head of R&aacute;hu which seeks now to devour the
informers&mdash;the Sun and Moon.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2228src"
href="#xd20e2228" name="xd20e2228src">3</a> Mythologically, too, this
R&aacute;hu has been divided; for we shall hereafter trace the
dragon-tail of him to the garden of Eden and in the christian devil,
whereas in India he has been improved from a vindictive to a merely
voracious demon.</p>
<p>The fires kindled by the Hindus to frighten R&aacute;hu on his
latest appearance might have defeated the purpose of the expedition by
the smoke it was sending up, had not two officers leaped upon the fire
and scattered its fuel; but just about the time when these courageous
gentlemen were trampling out the fires of superstition whose smoke
would obscure the vision of science, an event occurred in England which
must be traced to the same ancient belief&mdash;the belief, namely,
that when anything is apparently swallowed up, as the sun and moon by
an eclipse, or a village by earthquake or flood, it is the work of a
hungry dragon, earthworm, or other monster. The Pelsall mine was
flooded, and a large number of miners drowned. When the accident became
known in the village, the women went <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb47" href="#v1pb47" name="v1pb47">47</a>]</span>out with the
families of the unfortunate men, and sat beside the mouth of the
flooded pit, at the bottom of which the dead bodies yet remained. These
women then yelled down the pit with voices very different from ordinary
lamentation. They also refused unanimously to taste food of any kind,
saying, when pressed to do so, that so long as they could refrain from
eating, their husbands might still be spared to them. When, finally,
one poor woman, driven by the pangs of hunger, was observed to eat a
crust of bread, the cries ceased, and the women, renouncing all hope,
proceeded in silent procession to their homes in Pelsall.</p>
<p>The Hindu people casting their food out of the window during an
eclipse, the Pelsall wives refusing to eat when the mine is flooded,
are acting by force of immemorial tradition, and so are doing
unconsciously what the African woman does consciously when she
surrounds the bed of her sick husband with rice and meat, and beseeches
the demon to devour them instead of the man. To the same class of
notions belong the old custom of trying to discover the body of one
drowned by means of a loaf of bread with a candle stuck in it, which it
was said would pause above the body, and the body might be made to
appear by firing a gun over it&mdash;that is, the demon holding it
would be frightened off. A variant, too, is the Persian custom of
protecting a woman in parturition by spreading a table, with a lamp at
each corner, with seven kinds of fruits and seven different aromatic
seeds upon it.</p>
<p>In 1769, when Pennant made his &lsquo;Scottish Tour,&rsquo; he found
fully observed in the Highlands the ceremony of making the Beltane Cake
on the first of May, and dedicating its distributed fragments to birds
and beasts of prey, with invocation to the dread being of whom they
were the supposed agents to spare the herds. Demons <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb48" href="#v1pb48" name=
"v1pb48">48</a>]</span>especially love milk: the Lambton Worm required
nine cows&rsquo; milk daily; and Jerome mentions a diabolical baby
which exhausted six nurses.</p>
<p>The Devil nominally inherits, among the peasantry of Christendom,
the attributes of the demons which preceded him; but it must be
understood that in every case where mere voracity is ascribed to the
Devil, a primitive demon is meant, and of this fact the superstitious
peasant is dimly conscious. In Franconia, when a baker is about to put
dough biscuits into an oven to be baked, he will first throw
half-a-dozen of them into the fire, saying, &lsquo;There, poor devil!
those are for you.&rsquo; If pressed for an explanation, he will admit
his fear that but for this offering his biscuits are in danger of
coming out burnt; but that the &lsquo;poor devil&rsquo; is not
bad-hearted, only driven by his hunger to make mischief. The being he
fears is, therefore, clearly not the Devil at all&mdash;whose
distinction is a love of wickedness for its own sake&mdash;but the
half-starved gobbling ghosts of whom, in Christian countries,
&lsquo;Devil&rsquo; has become the generic name. Of their sacrifices,
Grace before meat is a remnant. In Moslem countries, however,
&lsquo;Sheitan&rsquo; combines the demonic and the malignant
voracities. During the late lunar eclipse, the inhabitants of Pera and
Constantinople fired guns over their houses to drive
&lsquo;Sheitan&rsquo; (Satan) away from the moon, for, whoever the foe,
the Turk trusts in gunpowder. But superstitions representing Satan as a
devourer are becoming rare. In the church of N&ocirc;tre Dame at Hal,
Belgium, the lectern shows a dragon attempting to swallow the Bible,
which is supported on the back of an eagle.</p>
<p>There is another and much more formidable form in which the
Hunger-demon appears in Demonology. The fondness for blood, so
characteristic of supreme gods, was distributed as a special thirst
through a large class of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb49" href=
"#v1pb49" name="v1pb49">49</a>]</span>demons. In the legend of Ishtar
descending to Hades<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2248src" href=
"#xd20e2248" name="xd20e2248src">4</a> to seek some beloved one, she
threatens if the door be not opened&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">I will raise the dead to be devourers of the
living!</p>
<p class="line">Upon the living shall the dead prey!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This menace shows that the Chald&aelig;an and
Babylonian belief in the vampyre, called Akhkharu in Assyrian, was
fully developed at a very early date. Although the Hunger-demon was
very fully developed in India, it does not appear to have been at any
time so cannibalistic, possibly because the natives were not great
flesh-eaters. In some cases, indeed, we meet with the vampyre
superstition; as in the story of Vikram and the Vampyre, and in the
Tamil drama of Harich&aacute;ndra, where the frenzied Sandram&aacute;ti
says to the king, &lsquo;I belong to the race of elves, and I have
killed thy child in order that I might feed on its delicate
flesh.&rsquo; Such expressions are rare enough to warrant suspicion of
their being importations. The Vetala&rsquo;s appetite is chiefly for
corpses. The poor hungry demons of India&mdash;such as the Bh&uacute;t,
a dismal, ravenous ghost, dreaded at the moon-wane of the month Katik
(Oct.-Nov.)&mdash;was not supposed to devour man, but only man&rsquo;s
food. The Hindu demons of this class may be explained by reference to
the sr&aacute;ddha, or oblation to ancestors, concerning which we read
directions in the Manu Code. &lsquo;The ancestors of men are satisfied
a whole month with <i>tila</i>, rice, &amp;c.; two months with fish,
&amp;c. The Manes say, Oh, may that man be born in our line who may
give us milky food, with honey and pure butter, both on the thirteenth
of the moon and when the shadow of an elephant falls to the
east!&rsquo; The bloodthirsty demons of India have pretty generally
been caught up like Kali into a higher symbolism, and their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb50" href="#v1pb50" name=
"v1pb50">50</a>]</span>voracity systematised and satisfied in
sacrificial commutations. The popular belief in the southern part of
that country is indicated by Professor Monier Williams, in a letter
written from Southern India, wherein he remarks that the devils alone
require propitiation. It is generally a simple procedure, performed by
offerings of food or other articles supposed to be acceptable to
disembodied beings. For example, when a certain European, once a terror
to the district in which he lived, died in the South of India, the
natives were in the constant habit of depositing brandy and cigars on
his tomb to propitiate his spirit, supposed to roam about the
neighbourhood in a restless manner, and with evil proclivities. The
very same was done to secure the good offices of the philanthropic
spirit of a great European sportsman, who, when he was alive, delivered
his district from the ravages of tigers. Indeed all evil spirits are
thought to be opposed by good ones, who, if duly propitiated, make it
their business to guard the inhabitants of particular places from
demonic intruders. Each district, and even every village, has its
guardian genius, often called its Mother.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2263src" href="#xd20e2263" name="xd20e2263src">5</a></p>
<p>Such ideas as these are represented in Europe in some varieties of
the Kobold and the Goblin (Gk. <span class="trans" title=
"kobalos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&kappa;&#8057;&beta;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>).
Though the goblin must, according to folk-philosophy, be fed with nice
food, it is not a deadly being; on the contrary, it is said the Gobelin
tapestry derives its name because the secret of its colours was gained
from these ghosts. Though St. Taurin expelled one from Evreux, he found
it so polite that he would not send it to hell, and it still haunts the
credulous there and at Caen, without being thought very formidable.</p>
<p>The demon that &lsquo;lurks in graveyards&rsquo; is universal, and
may have suggested cremation. In the East it is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb51" href="#v1pb51" name=
"v1pb51">51</a>]</span>represented mainly by such forms as the
repulsive <i>ghoul</i>, which preys on dead bodies; but it has been
developed in some strange way to the Slavonic phantom called Vampyre,
whose peculiar fearfulness is that it represents the form in which any
deceased person may reappear, not ghoul-like to batten on the dead, but
to suck the blood of the living. This is perhaps the most formidable
survival of demonic superstition now existing in the world.</p>
<p>A people who still have in their dictionary such a word as
&lsquo;miscreant&rsquo; (misbeliever) can hardly wonder that the
priests of the Eastern Church fostered the popular belief that heretics
at death changed into drinkers of the blood of the living. The Slavonic
vampyres have declined in England and America to be the
&lsquo;Ogres,&rsquo; who &lsquo;smell the blood of an
Englishman,&rsquo; but are rarely supposed to enjoy it; but it exposes
the real ugliness of the pious superstitions sometimes deemed pretty,
that, in proportion to the intensity of belief in supernaturalism, the
people live in terror of the demons that go about seeking whom they may
devour. In Russia the watcher beside a corpse is armed with holy charms
against attack from it at midnight. A vampyre may be the soul of any
outcast from the Church, or one over whose corpse, before burial, a cat
has leaped or a bird flown. It may be discovered in a graveyard by
leading a black colt through; the animal will refuse to tread on the
vampyre&rsquo;s grave, and the body is taken out and a stake driven
through it, always by a single blow. A related class of demons are the
&lsquo;heart-devourers.&rsquo; They touch their victim with an aspen or
other magical twig; the heart falls out, and is, perhaps, replaced by
some baser one. Mr. Ralston mentions a Mazovian story in which a hero
awakes with the heart of a hare, and remains a coward ever
after;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2285src" href="#xd20e2285" name=
"xd20e2285src">6</a> and in another case a quiet peasant <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb52" href="#v1pb52" name=
"v1pb52">52</a>]</span>received a cock&rsquo;s heart and was always
crowing. The Werewolf, in some respects closely related to the vampyre,
also pursues his ravages among the priest-ridden peasantry of the South
and East.</p>
<p>In Germany, though the more horrible forms of the superstition are
rare, the &lsquo;Nachzehrer&rsquo; is much dreaded. Even in various
Protestant regions it is thought safest that a cross should be set
beside every grave to impede any demonic propensities that may take
possession of the person interred; and where food is not still buried
with the corpse to assuage any pangs of hunger that may arise, a few
grains of corn or rice are scattered upon it in reminiscence of the old
custom. In Diesdorf it is believed that if money is not placed in the
dead person&rsquo;s mouth at burial, or his name not cut from his
shirt, he is likely to become a Nachzehrer, and that the ghost will
come forth in the form of a pig. It is considered a sure preventative
of such a result to break the neck of the dead body. On one occasion,
it is there related, several persons of one family having died, the
suspected corpse was exhumed, and found to have eaten up its own
grave-clothes.</p>
<p>Dr. Dyer, an eminent physician of Chicago, Illinois, told me (1875)
that a case occurred in that city within his personal knowledge, where
the body of a woman who had died of consumption was taken out of the
grave and the lungs burned, under a belief that she was drawing after
her into the grave some of her surviving relatives. In 1874, according
to the <i>Providence Journal</i>, in the village of Peacedale, Rhode
Island, U.S., Mr. William Rose dug up the body of his own daughter, and
burned her heart, under the belief that she was wasting away the lives
of other members of his family.</p>
<p>The characteristics of modern &lsquo;Spiritualism&rsquo; appear to
indicate that the superstitious have outgrown this ancient <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb53" href="#v1pb53" name=
"v1pb53">53</a>]</span>fear of ghostly malevolence where surrounded by
civilisation. It is very rare in the ancient world or in barbarous
regions to find any invocations for the return of the spirits of the
dead. Mr. Tylor has quoted a beautiful dirge used by the Ho tribe of
India, beginning&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">We never scolded you, never wronged you;</p>
<p class="line xd20e2305">Come to us back!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But generally funereal customs are very significant of
the fear that spirits may return, and their dirges more in the vein of
the Bodo of North-East India: &lsquo;Take and eat: heretofore you have
eaten and drunk with us, you can do so no more: you were one of us, you
can be so no longer: we come no more to you, come you not to us.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Even,&rsquo; says Mr. Tylor, &lsquo;in the lowest culture we
find flesh holding its own against spirit, and at higher stages the
householder rids himself with little scruple of an unwelcome inmate.
The Greenlanders would carry the dead out by the window, not by the
door, while an old woman, waving a firebrand behind, cried
&lsquo;Piklerrukpok!&rsquo; <i>i.e.,</i> &lsquo;There is nothing more
to be had here!&rsquo; the Hottentots removed the dead from the hut by
an opening broken out on purpose, to prevent him from finding the way
back; the Siamese, with the same intention, break an opening through
the house wall to carry the coffin through, and then hurry it at full
speed thrice round the house; the Siberian Chuwashes fling a red-hot
stone after the corpse is carried out, for an obstacle to bar the soul
from coming back; so Brandenburg peasants pour out a pail of water at
the door after the coffin to prevent the ghost from walking; and
Pomeranian mourners returning from the churchyard leave behind the
straw from the hearse, that the wandering soul may rest there, and not
come back so far as home.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2312src"

<p>It may be remarked, in this connection, that in nearly all the
pictures of demons and devils, they are represented as very lean. The
exceptions will be found generally in certain Southern and tropical
demons which represent cloud or storm&mdash;Typhon, for
instance&mdash;and present a swollen or bloated appearance. No Northern
devil is fat. Shakespeare ascribes to C&aelig;sar a suspicion of
leanness&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Yond&rsquo; Cassius hath a lean and hungry look:</p>
<p class="line">He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">When Antony defends Cassius, C&aelig;sar only replies,
&lsquo;Would he were fatter!&rsquo; This mistrust of leanness is a
reflection from all the Hunger-demons; it interprets the old sayings
that a devil, however fair in front, may be detected by hollowness of
the back, and that he is usually so thin as to cast no shadow.<a class=

<p>Illustrations of the Hunger-demon and its survivals might be greatly
multiplied, were it necessary. It need only, however, be mentioned that
it is to this early and most universal conception of
pr&aelig;ternatural danger that the idea of sacrifice as well as of
fasting must be ascribed. It is, indeed, too obvious to require
extended demonstration that the notion of offering fruits and meat to
an invisible being could only have originated in the belief that such
being was hungry, however much the spiritualisation of such offerings
may have attended their continuance among enlightened peoples. In the
evolution of purer deities, Fire&mdash;&lsquo;the devouring
element&rsquo;&mdash;was substituted for a coarser method of accepting
sacrifices, and it became a sign of baser beings&mdash;such as the
Assyrian Akhkharu, and the later Lamia&mdash;to consume dead bodies
with their teeth; and this fire was the spiritual element in the
idolatries whose objects were visible. But the original accent of
sacrifice never left it. The Levitical Law says: &lsquo;The two
kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the
caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away. And the
priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering
made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat is the Lord&rsquo;s. It
shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your
dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.&rsquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e2339src" href="#xd20e2339" name="xd20e2339src">9</a> We find
the Hunger-demon shown as well in the wrath of Jehovah against the sons
of Eli for eating the choice parts of the meats offered on his altar,
as in that offering of tender infants to Moloch which his priests
denounced, or in Saturn devouring his children, whom Aryan faith
dethroned; and they all reappear as phantoms thinly veiled above the
spotless Lamb offered up on Calvary, the sacrificed Macaria
(&lsquo;Blessed&rsquo;), the pierced heart of Mary. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb56" href="#v1pb56" name=
"v1pb56">56</a>]</span>The beautiful boy Men&oelig;ceus must be
sacrificed to save Thebes; the gods will not have aged and tough Creon,
though a king, in his place. Iphigenia, though herself saved from the
refined palate of Artemis, through the huntress&rsquo;s fondness for
kid&rsquo;s blood, becomes the priestess of human sacrifices. The human
offering deemed half-divine could alone at last satisfy the Deity,
gathered in his side this sheaf of sacrificial knives, whetted in many
lands and ages, and in his self-sacrifice the Hunger-demon himself was
made the victim. Theologians have been glad to rescue the First Person
of their Trinity from association with the bloodthirsty demons of
barbarous ages by describing the sacrifice of Jesus as God himself
becoming the victim of an eternal law. But, whatever may be said of
this complex device, it is sufficient evidence that man&rsquo;s
primitive demon which personified his hunger has ended with being
consumed on his own altar. For though fasting is a survival of the same
savage notion that man may secure benefits from invisible beings by
leaving them the food, it is a practice which survives rather through
the desire of imitating ascetic saints than because of any understood
principle. The strange yet natural consummation adds depth of meaning
to the legend of Odin being himself sacrificed in his disguise on the
Holy Tree at Upsala, where human victims were hung as offerings to him;
and to his rune in the Havamal&mdash;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Fire was of old the element of fiends. No doubt this
was in part due to the fact that it also was a devouring element.
Sacrifices were burnt; the demon visibly consumed them. But the great
flame-demons represent chiefly the destructive and painful action of
intense heat. They originate in regions of burning desert, of
sunstroke, and drouth.</p>
<p>Agni, the Hindu god of fire, was adored in Vedic hymns as the twin
of Indra.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thy appearance is fair to behold, thou bright-faced Agni,
when like gold thou shinest at hand; thy brightness comes like the
lightning of heaven; thou showest splendour like the splendour of the
bright sun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Adorable and excellent Agni, emit the moving and graceful
smoke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The flames of Agni are luminous, powerful, fearful, and not
to be trusted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I extol the greatness of that showerer of rain, whom men
celebrate as the slayer of Vritra: the Agni, Vaiswanara, slew the
stealer of the waters.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb58"
href="#v1pb58" name="v1pb58">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>The slaying of Vritra, the monster, being the chief exploit of
Indra, Agni could only share in it as being the flame that darted with
Indra&rsquo;s weapon, the disc (of the sun).</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou (Agni) art laid hold off with difficulty, like the young
of tortuously twining snakes, thou who art a consumer of many forests
as a beast is of fodder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Petrifaction awaits all these glowing metaphors of early time.
Verbal inspiration will make Agni a literally tortuous serpent and
consuming fire. His smoke, called Kali (black), is now the name of
Siva&rsquo;s terrible bride.</p>
<p>Much is said in Vedic hymns of the method of producing the sacred
flame symbolising Agni; namely, the rubbing together of two sticks.
&lsquo;He it is whom the two sticks have engendered, like a new-born
babe.&rsquo; It is a curious coincidence that a similar phrase should
describe &lsquo;the devil on two sticks,&rsquo; who has come by way of
Persia into European romance. Asmodeus was a lame demon, and his
&lsquo;two sticks&rsquo; as &lsquo;Diable Boiteux&rsquo; are crutches;
but his lameness may be referable to the attenuated extremities
suggested by spires of flame&mdash;&lsquo;tortuously twining
snakes,&rsquo;&mdash;rather than to the rabbinical myth that he broke
his leg on his way to meet Solomon. Benfey identified Asmodeus as Zend
A&ecirc;shma-da&ecirc;va, demon of lust. His goat-feet and fire-coal
eyes are described by Le Sage, and the demon says he was lamed by
falling from the air, like Vulcan, when contending with Pillardoc. It
is not difficult to imagine how flame engendered by the rubbing of
sticks might have attained personification as sensual passion,
especially among Zoroastrians, who would detach from the adorable Fire
all associations of evil. It would harmonise well with the Persian
tendency to diabolise Indian gods, that they should note the lustful
character occasionally ascribed to Agni in the Vedas. &lsquo;Him alone,
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb59" href="#v1pb59" name=
"v1pb59">59</a>]</span>ever-youthful Agni, men groom like a horse in
the evening and at dawn; they bed him as a stranger in his couch; the
light of Agni, the worshipped male, is lighted.&rsquo; Agni was the
Indian &lsquo;Brulefer&rsquo; or love-charmer, and patron of marriage;
the fire-god Hephaistos was the husband of Aphrodite; the day of the
Norse thunder-and-lightning god Thor (Thursday), is in Scandinavian
regions considered the luckiest for marriages.</p>
<p>The process of obtaining fire by friction is represented by a nobler
class of myths than that referred to. In the
<i>Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata</i> the gods and demons together churn the
ocean for the nectar of immortality; and they use for their
churning-stick the mountain Manthara. This word appears in
<i>pramantha,</i> which means a fire-drill, and from it comes the great
name of Prometheus, who stole fire from heaven, and conferred on
mankind a boon which rendered them so powerful that the jealousy and
wrath of Zeus were excited. This fable is generally read in its highly
rationalised and mystical form, and on this account belongs to another
part of our general subject; but it may be remarked here that the Titan
so terribly tortured by Zeus could hardly have been regarded,
originally, as the friend of man. At the time when Zeus was a god
genuinely worshipped&mdash;when he first stood forth as the supplanter
of the malign devourer Saturn&mdash;it could have been no friend of man
who was seen chained on the rock for ever to be the vulture&rsquo;s
prey. It was fire in some destructive form which must have been then
associated with Prometheus, and not that power by which later myths
represented his animating with a divine spark the man of clay. The
Hindu myth of churning the ocean for the immortal draught, even if it
be proved that the ocean is heaven and the draught lightning, does not
help us much. The traditional association of Prometheus with the Arts
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb60" href="#v1pb60" name=
"v1pb60">60</a>]</span>might almost lead one to imagine that the early
use of fire by some primitive inventor had brought upon him the wrath
of his mates, and that Zeus&rsquo; thunderbolts represented some early
&lsquo;strike&rsquo; against machinery.</p>
<p>It is not quite certain that it may not have been through some
euphemistic process that Fire-worship arose in Persia. Not only does
fire occupy a prominent place in the tortures inflicted by Ahriman in
the primitive Parsee Inferno, but it was one of the weapons by which he
attempted to destroy the heavenly child Zoroaster. The evil magicians
kindled a fire in the desert and threw the child on it; but his mother,
Dogdo, found him sleeping tranquilly on the flames, which were as a
pleasant bath, and his face shining like Zohore and Moschteri (Jupiter
and Mercury).<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2404src" href="#xd20e2404"
name="xd20e2404src">1</a> The Zoroastrians also held that the earth
would ultimately be destroyed by fire; its metals and minerals, ignited
by a comet, would form streams which all souls would have to pass
through: they would be pleasant to the righteous, but terrible to the
sinful,&mdash;who, however, would come through, purified, into
paradise, the last to arrive being Ahriman himself.</p>
<p>The combustible nature of many minerals under the surface of the
earth,&mdash;which was all the realm of Hades (invisible),&mdash;would
assist the notion of a fiery abode for the infernal gods. Our phrase
&lsquo;plutonic rock&rsquo; would then have a very prosaic sense. Pliny
says that in his time sulphur was used to keep off evil spirits, and it
is not impossible that it first came to be used as a medicine by this
route.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2412src" href="#xd20e2412" name=
"xd20e2412src">2</a></p>
<p>Fire-festivals still exist in India, where the ancient <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb61" href="#v1pb61" name=
"v1pb61">61</a>]</span>raiment of Agni has been divided up and
distributed among many deities. At the popular annual festival in
honour of Dharma Rajah, called the Feast of Fire, the devotees walk
barefoot over a glowing fire extending forty feet. It lasts eighteen
days, during which time those that make a vow to keep it must fast,
abstain from women, lie on the bare ground, and walk on a brisk fire.
The eighteenth day they assemble on the sound of instruments, their
heads crowned with flowers, their bodies daubed with saffron, and
follow the figures of Dharma Rajah and Draupadi his wife in procession.
When they come to the fire, they stir it to animate its activity, and
take a little of the ashes, with which they rub their foreheads; and
when the gods have been carried three times round it they walk over a
hot fire, about forty feet. Some carry their children in their arms,
and others lances, sabres, and standards. After the ceremony the people
press to collect the ashes to rub their foreheads with, and obtain from
devotees the flowers with which they were adorned, and which they
carefully preserve.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2422src" href=
"#xd20e2422" name="xd20e2422src">3</a></p>
<p>The passion of Agni reappears in Draupadi purified by fire for her
five husbands, and especially her union with Dharma Rajah, son of Yama,
is celebrated in this unorthodox passion-feast. It has been so much the
fashion for travellers to look upon all &lsquo;idolatry&rsquo; with
biblical eyes, that we cannot feel certain with Sonnerat that there was
anything more significant in the carrying of children by the devotees,
than the supposition that what was good for the parent was equally
beneficial to the child. But the identification of Moloch with an Aryan
deity is not important; the Indian Feast of Fire and the rites of
Moloch are derived by a very simple mental process from the most
obvious aspects of the Sun as the quickening <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb62" href="#v1pb62" name=
"v1pb62">62</a>]</span>and the consuming power in nature. The child
offered to Moloch was offered to the god by whom he was generated, and
as the most precious of all the fruits of the earth for which his
genial aid was implored and his destructive intensity deprecated.
Moloch, a word that means &lsquo;<span class="corr" id="xd20e2429"
title="Source: sacrifice">king</span>,&rsquo; <span class="corr" id=
"xd20e2432" title="Not in source">was a name almost synonymous with
human sacrifice. It</span> was in all probability at first only a local
(Ammonite) personification growing out of an ancient shrine of Baal.
The Midianite Baal accompanied the Israelites into the wilderness, and
that worship was never thoroughly eradicated. In the Egyptian
Confession of Faith, which the initiated took even into their graves
inscribed upon a scroll, the name of God is not mentioned, but is
expressed only by the words <i>Nuk pu Nuk</i>, &lsquo;I am he who I
am.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2438src" href="#xd20e2438" name=
"xd20e2438src">4</a> The flames of the burning bush, from which these
same words came to Moses, were kindled from Baal, the Sun; and we need
not wonder that while the more enlightened chiefs of Israel preserved
the higher ideas and symbols of the countries they abandoned, the
ignorant would still cling to Apis (the Golden Calf), to Ashtaroth, and
to Moloch. Amos (v. 26), and after him Stephen the martyr (Acts vii.
43), reproach the Hebrews with having carried into the wilderness the
tabernacle of their god Moloch. And though the passing of children
through the fire to Moloch was, by the Mosaic Law, made a capital
crime, the superstition and the corresponding practice retained such
strength that we find Solomon building a temple to Moloch on the Mount
of Olives (1 Kings xi. 7), and, long after, Manasseh making his son
pass through the fire in honour of the same god.</p>
<p>It is certain from the denunciations of the prophets<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e2453src" href="#xd20e2453" name="xd20e2453src">5</a>
that the destruction of children in these flames was actual. From
Jeremiah xix. 6, as well as other sources, we know that the burnings
took place in the Valley of Tophet or <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb63" href="#v1pb63" name="v1pb63">63</a>]</span>Hinnom (Gehenna).
The idol Moloch was of brass, and its throne of brass; its head was
that of a calf, and wore a royal crown; its stomach was a furnace, and
when the children were placed in its arms they were consumed by the
fierce heat,&mdash;their cries being drowned by the beating of drums;
from which, <i>toph</i> meaning a &lsquo;drum,&rsquo; the place was
also called Tophet. In the fierce war waged against alien superstitions
by Josiah, he defiled Gehenna, filling it with ordure and dead
men&rsquo;s bones to make it odious, &lsquo;that no man might make his
son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Moloch&rsquo; (2 Kings
xxiii. 10), and a perpetual fire was kept there to consume the filth of
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>From this horrible Gehenna, with its perpetual fire, its loathsome
worm, its cruelties, has been derived the picture of a never-ending
Hell prepared for the majority of human beings by One who, while they
live on earth, sends the rain and sunshine alike on the evil and the
good. Wo Chang, a Chinaman in London, has written to a journal<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e2477src" href="#xd20e2477" name="xd20e2477src">6</a>
his surprise that our religious teachers should be seized with such
concern for the victims of Turkish atrocities in Bulgaria, while they
are so calm in view of the millions burning, and destined to burn
endlessly, in the flames of hell. Our Oriental brothers will learn a
great deal from our missionaries; among other things, that the
theological god of Christendom is still Moloch.</p>
<p>The Ammonites, of whom Moloch was the special demon, appear to have
gradually blended with the Arabians. These received from many sources
their mongrel superstitions, but among them were always prominent the
planet-gods and fire-gods, whom their growing monotheism (to use the
word still in a loose sense) transformed to powerful angels and genii.
The genii of Arabia are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb64" href=
"#v1pb64" name="v1pb64">64</a>]</span>slaves of the lamp; they are
evoked by burning tufts of hair; they ascend as clouds of smoke.
Though, as subordinate agents of the Fire-fiend, they may be consumed
by flames, yet those who so fight them are apt to suffer a like fate,
as in the case of the Lady of Beauty in the Arabian Nights&rsquo;
Entertainments. Many stories of this kind preceded the declarations of
the Old Testament, that Jehovah breathes fire and brimstone, his breath
kindling Tophet; and also the passages of the Koran, and of the New
Testament describing Satan as a fiery fiend.</p>
<p>Various superstitions connecting infernal powers with fire survive
among the Jews of some remote districts of Europe. The Passover is kept
a week by the Jewish inhabitants in the villages on the Vosges
mountains and on the banks of the Rhine. The time of <i>omer</i> is the
interval between the Passover and Pentecost, the seven weeks elapsing
from the departure from Egypt and the giving of the law, marked in
former days by the offering of an omer of barley daily at the temple.
It is considered a fearful time, during which every Jew is particularly
exposed to the evil influence of evil spirits. There is something
dangerous and fatal in the air; every one should be on the watch, and
not tempt the <i>schedim</i> (demons) in any way. Have a strict eye
upon your cattle, say the Jews, for the sorceress will get into your
stables, mount your cows and goats, bring diseases upon them, and turn
their milk sour. In the latter case, try to lay your hand upon the
suspected person; shut her up in a room with a basin of sour milk, and
beat the milk with a hazel-wand, pronouncing God&rsquo;s name three
times. Whilst you are doing this, the sorceress will make great
lamentation, for the blows are falling upon her. Only stop when you see
blue flames dancing on the surface of the milk, for then the charm is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb65" href="#v1pb65" name=
"v1pb65">65</a>]</span>broken. If at nightfall a beggar comes to ask
for a little charcoal to light his fire, be very careful not to give
it, and do not let him go without drawing him three times by his
coat-tail; and without losing time, throw some large handfuls of salt
on the fire. In all of which we may trace traditions of parched
wildernesses and fiery serpents, as well as of Abraham&rsquo;s long
warfare with the Fire-worshippers, until, according to the tradition,
he was thrown into the flames he refused to worship.</p>
<p>It is probable that in all the popular superstitions which now
connect devils and future punishments with fire are blended both the
apotheosis and the degradation of demons. The first and most universal
of deities being the Sun, whose earthly representative is fire, the
student of Comparative Mythology has to pick his way very carefully in
tracing by any ethnological path the innumerable superstitions of
European folklore in which Fire-worship is apparently reflected. The
collection of facts and records contained in a work so accessible to
all who care to pursue the subject as that of Brand and his
editors,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2497src" href="#xd20e2497" name=
"xd20e2497src">7</a> renders it unnecessary that I should go into the
curious facts to any great extent here. The uniformity of the
traditions by which the midsummer fires of Northern Europe have been
called Baal-fires or Bel-fires warrant the belief that they are
actually descended from the ancient rites of Baal, even apart from the
notorious fact that they have so generally been accompanied by the
superstition that it is a benefit to children to leap over or be passed
through such fires. That this practice still survives in out-of-the way
places of the British Empire appears from such communications as the
following (from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb66" href=
"#v1pb66" name="v1pb66">66</a>]</span><i>Times</i>), which are
occasionally addressed to the London
journals:&mdash;&lsquo;<span class="sc">Lerwick</span> (Shetland),
<i>July 7, 1871</i>.&mdash;<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;It may
interest some of your readers to know that last night (being St.
John&rsquo;s Eve, old style) I observed, within a mile or so of this
town, seven bonfires blazing, in accordance with the immemorial custom
of celebrating the Midsummer solstice. These fires were kindled on
various heights around the ancient hamlet of Sound, and the children
leaped over them, and &lsquo;passed through the fire to Moloch,&rsquo;
just as their ancestors would have done a thousand years ago on the
same heights, and their still remoter progenitors in Eastern lands many
thousand years ago. This persistent adherence to mystic rites in this
scientific epoch seems to me worth taking note of.&mdash;A.
J.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To this may be added the following recent extract from a Scotch
journal:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hallowe&rsquo;en was celebrated at Balmoral Castle with
unusual ceremony, in the presence of her Majesty, the Princess
Beatrice, the ladies and gentlemen of the royal household, and a large
gathering of the tenantry. The leading features of the celebration were
a torchlight procession, the lighting of large bonfires, and the
burning in effigy of witches and warlocks. Upwards of 150 torch-bearers
assembled at the castle as dark set in, and separated into two parties,
one band proceeding to Invergelder, and the other remaining at
Balmoral. The torches were lighted at a quarter before six
o&rsquo;clock, and shortly after the Queen and Princess Beatrice drove
to Invergelder, followed by the Balmoral party of torchbearers. The two
parties then united and returned in procession to the front of Balmoral
Castle, where refreshments were served to all, and dancing was engaged
in round a huge bonfire. Suddenly there appeared from the rear of the
Castle a grotesque apparition representing a witch with a train of
followers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb67" href="#v1pb67" name=
"v1pb67">67</a>]</span>dressed like sprites, who danced and
gesticulated in all fashions. Then followed a warlock of demoniac
shape, who was succeeded by another warlock drawing a car, on which was
seated the figure of a witch, surrounded by other figures in the garb
of demons. The unearthly visitors having marched several times round
the burning pile, the principal figure was taken from the car and
tossed into the flames amid the burning of blue lights and a display of
crackers and fireworks. The health of her Majesty the Queen was then
pledged, and drunk with Highland honours by the assembled hundreds.
Dancing was then resumed, and was carried on till a late hour at
night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Sixth Council of Constantinople (an. 680), by its sixty-fifth
canon, forbids these fires in the following terms:&mdash;&lsquo;Those
bonefires that are kindled by certain people before their shops and
houses, over which also they use ridiculously to leap, by a certain
ancient custom, we command them from henceforth to cease. Whoever,
therefore, shall do any such thing, if he be a clergyman, let him be
deposed; if he be a layman, let him be excommunicated. For in the
Fourth Book of the Kings it is thus written: And Manasseh built an
altar to all the host of heaven, in the two courts of the Lord&rsquo;s
house, and made his children to pass through the fire.&rsquo; There is
a charming na&iuml;vet&eacute; in this denunciation. It is no longer
doubtful that this &lsquo;bonefire&rsquo; over which people leaped came
from the same source as that Gehenna from which the Church derived the
orthodox theory of hell, as we have already seen. When Shakespeare
speaks (Macbeth) of &lsquo;the primrose way to the everlasting
bonfire,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2521src" href="#xd20e2521"
name="xd20e2521src">8</a> he is, with his wonted felicity, assigning
the flames of hell and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb68" href=
"#v1pb68" name="v1pb68">68</a>]</span>the fires of Moloch and Baal
their right arch&aelig;ological relation.</p>
<p>In my boyhood I have often leaped over a bonfire in a part of the
State of Virginia mainly settled by Scotch families, with whom probably
the custom migrated thither. In the superstitions of the negroes of
that and other Southern States fire plays a large part, but it is
hardly possible now to determine whether they have drifted there from
Africa or England. Sometimes there are queer coincidences between their
notions and some of the early legends of Britain. Thus, the tradition
of the shepherd guided by a distant fire to the entrance of King
Arthur&rsquo;s subterranean hall, where a flame fed by no fuel coming
through the floor reveals the slumbering monarch and his court,
resembles somewhat stories I have heard from negroes of their being led
by distant fires to lucky&mdash;others say unlucky&mdash;or at any rate
enchanted spots. A negro belonging to my father told me that once, as
he was walking on a country road, he saw a great fire in the distance;
he supposed it must be a house on fire, and hastened towards it,
meantime much puzzled, since he knew of no house in that direction. As
he went on his way he turned into a small wood near which the fire
seemed to be, but when he emerged, all he found was a single fire-coal
burning in the path. There were no other traces whatever of fire, but
just then a large dog leaped past him with a loud bark and
disappeared.</p>
<p>In a letter on &lsquo;Voudouism in Virginia,&rsquo; which appeared
in the <i>New York Tribune</i>, dated Richmond, September 17, 1875,
occurs an account of a class of superstitions generally kept close from
the whites, as I have always believed because of their purely African
origin. As will be seen, fire represents an important element in the
superstitious practices. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb69" href=
"#v1pb69" name="v1pb69">69</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;If an ignorant negro is smitten with a disease which he
cannot comprehend, he often imagines himself the victim of witchcraft,
and having no faith in &lsquo;white folks&rsquo; physic&rsquo; for such
ailments, must apply to one of these quacks. A physician residing near
this city was invited by such a one to witness his mode of procedure
with a dropsical patient for whom the physician in question had
occasionally charitably prescribed. Curiosity led him to attend the
seance, having previously informed the quack that since the case was in
such hands he relinquished all connection with it. On the coverlet of
the bed on which the sick man lay was spread a quantity of bones,
feathers, and other trash. The charlatan went through with a series of
so-called conjurations, burned feathers, hair, and tiny fragments of
wood in a charcoal furnace, and mumbled gibberish past the
physician&rsquo;s comprehension. He then proceeded to rip open the
pillows and bolsters, and took from them some queer conglomerations of
feathers. These he said had caused all the trouble. Sprinkling a
whitish powder over them, he burnt them in his furnace. A black
offensive smoke was produced, and he announced triumphantly that the
evil influence was destroyed and that the patient would surely get
well. He died not many days later, believing, in common with all his
friends and relatives, that the conjurations of the &lsquo;trick
doctor&rsquo; had failed to save him only because resorted to too
late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The following account of a spell from which his wife was rescued,
was given me by a negro in Virginia:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The wizard,&rsquo; to quote the exact words of my informant,
&lsquo;threw a stick on a chest; the stick bounded like a trapball
three times; then he opened the chest, took out something looking like
dust or clay, and put it into a cup with water over a fire; then he
poured it over a board (after chopping it three times), which he then
put up <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb70" href="#v1pb70" name=
"v1pb70">70</a>]</span>beneath the shingles of the house. Returning to
the chest he took a piece of old chain, near the length of my hand,
took a hoe and buried the chain near the sill of the door of my
wife&rsquo;s house where she would pass; then he went away. I saw my
wife coming and called to her not to pass, and to go for a hoe and dig
up the place. She did this, and I took up the chain, which burned the
ends of all my fingers clean off. The same night the conjuror came
back: my wife took two half dollars and a quarter in silver and threw
them on the ground before him. The man seemed as if he was shocked, and
then offered her his hand, which she refused to take, as I had bid her
not to let him touch her. He left and never came to the house again.
The spell was broken.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I am convinced that this is a pure Voudou procedure, and it is
interesting in several regards. The introduction of the chain may have
been the result of the excitement of the time, for it was during the
war when negroes were breaking their chains. The fire and water show
how wide-spread in Africa is that double ordeal which, as we have seen,
is well known in the kingdom of Dahomey.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2553src" href="#xd20e2553" name="xd20e2553src">9</a> But the
mingling of &lsquo;something like dust&rsquo; with the water held in a
cup over the fire, is strongly suggestive of the Jewish method of
preparing holy water, &lsquo;the water of separation.&rsquo; &lsquo;For
an unclean person they shall take of the dust of the burnt heifer of
purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a
vessel.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2556src" href="#xd20e2556"
name="xd20e2556src">10</a> The fiery element of the mixture was in this
case imported with the ashes of the red heifer. As for this sacrifice
of the red heifer itself<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2561src" href=
"#xd20e2561" name="xd20e2561src">11</a> it was plainly the propitiation
of a fiery demon. In Egypt red hair and red animals of all kinds were
considered infernal, and all the details of this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb71" href="#v1pb71" name=
"v1pb71">71</a>]</span>sacrifice show that the colour of this selected
heifer was typical. The heifer was not a usual sacrifice: a red one was
obviously by its colour marked for the genii of fire&mdash;the terrible
Seven&mdash;and not to be denied them. Its blood was sprinkled seven
times before the tabernacle, and the rest was utterly
consumed&mdash;including the hide, which is particularly
mentioned&mdash;and the ashes taken to make the &lsquo;water of
separation.&rsquo; Calmet notes, in this connection, that the Apis of
India was red-coloured.</p>
<p>The following interesting story of the Chinese Fire-god was supplied
to Mr. Dennys<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2573src" href="#xd20e2573"
name="xd20e2573src">12</a> by Mr. Playfair of H.M. Consulate, to whom
it was related in Peking:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The temples of the God of Fire are numerous in Peking, as is
natural in a city built for the most part of very combustible
materials. The idols representing the god are, with one exception,
decked with red beards, typifying by their colour the element under his
control. The exceptional god has a white beard, and &lsquo;thereby
hangs a tale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A hundred years ago the Chinese imperial revenue was in much
better case than it is now. At that time they had not yet come into
collision with Western Powers, and the word &lsquo;indemnity&rsquo; had
not, so far, found a place in their vocabulary; internal rebellions
were checked as soon as they broke out, and, in one word, Kien Lung was
in less embarrassed circumstances than Kwang Hsu; he had more money to
spend, and did lay out a good deal in the way of palaces. His favourite
building, and one on which no expense had been spared, was the
&lsquo;Hall of Contemplation.&rsquo; This hall was of very large
dimensions; the rafters and the pillars which supported the roof were
of a size such as no trees in China furnish now-a-days. They were not
improbably originally sent as an offering by the tributary monarch of
some tropical country, such as Burmah or <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb72" href="#v1pb72" name="v1pb72">72</a>]</span>Siam. Two men could
barely join hands round the pillars; they were cased in lustrous
jet-black lacquer, which, while adding to the beauty of their
appearance, was also supposed to make them less liable to combustion.
Indeed, every care was taken that no fire should approach the building;
no lighted lamp was allowed in the precincts, and to have smoked a pipe
inside those walls would have been punished with death. The floor of
the hall was of different-coloured marbles, in a mosaic of flowers and
mystic Chinese characters, always kept polished like a mirror. The
sides of the room were lined with rare books and precious manuscripts.
It was, in short, the finest palace in the imperial city, and it was
the pride of Kien Lung.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alas for the vanity of human wishes! In spite of every
precaution, one night a fire broke out, and the Hall of Contemplation
was in danger. The Chinese of a century ago were not without
fire-engines, and though miserably inefficient as compared with those
of our London fire brigade, they were better than nothing, and a
hundred of them were soon working round the burning building. The
Emperor himself came out to superintend their efforts and encourage
them to renewed exertions. But the hall was doomed; a more than earthly
power was directing the flames, and mortal efforts were of no avail.
For on one of the burning rafters Kien Lung saw the figure of a little
old man, with a long white beard, standing in a triumphant attitude.
&lsquo;It is the God of Fire,&rsquo; said the Emperor, &lsquo;we can do
nothing;&rsquo; so the building was allowed to blaze in peace. Next day
Kien Lung appointed a commission to go the round of the Peking temples
in order to discover in which of them there was a Fire-god with a white
beard, that he might worship him, and appease the offended deity. The
search was fruitless; all the Fire-gods had red beards. But the
commission had done its work badly; being highly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb73" href="#v1pb73" name=
"v1pb73">73</a>]</span>respectable mandarins of genteel families, they
had confined their search to such temples as were in good repair and of
creditable exterior. Outside the north gate of the imperial city was
one old, dilapidated, disreputable shrine which they had overlooked. It
had been crumbling away for years, and even the dread figure of the God
of Fire, which sat above the altar, had not escaped desecration.
&lsquo;Time had thinned his flowing locks,&rsquo; and the beard had
fallen away altogether. One day some water-carriers who frequented the
locality thought, either in charity or by way of a joke, that the face
would look the better for a new beard. So they unravelled some cord,
and with the frayed-out hemp adorned the beardless chin. An official
passing the temple one day peeped in out of curiosity, and saw the
hempen beard. &lsquo;Just the thing the Emperor was inquiring
about,&rsquo; said he to himself, and he took the news to the palace
without delay. Next day there was a state visit to the dilapidated
temple, and Kien Lung made obeisance and vowed a vow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Fire-god,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;thou hast been wroth with
me in that I have built me palaces, and left thy shrine unhonoured and
in ruins. Here do I vow to build thee a temple surpassed by none other
of the Fire-gods in Peking; but I shall expect thee in future not to
meddle with my palaces.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Emperor was as good as his word. The new temple is on the
site of the old one, and the Fire-god has a flowing beard of fine white
hair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the San Francisco <i>Bulletin</i>, I recently read a description
of the celebration by the Chinese in that city of their Feast for the
Dead, in which there are some significant features. The chief attention
was paid, says the reporter, to a figure &lsquo;representing what
answers in their theology to our devil, and whom they evidently
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb74" href="#v1pb74" name=
"v1pb74">74</a>]</span>think it necessary to propitiate before
proceeding with their worship over individual graves.&rsquo; This
figure is on the west side of their temple; before and around it
candles and joss-sticks were kept burning. On the east side was the
better-looking figure, to which they paid comparatively little
attention.</p>
<p>It was of course but natural that the demons of fire should
gradually be dispelled from that element in its normal aspects, as its
uses became more important through human invention, and its evil
possibilities were mastered. Such demons became gradually located in
the region of especially dangerous fires, as volcanoes and boiling
springs. The Titan whom the ancients believed struggling beneath
&AElig;tna remained there as the Devil in the christian age. St. Agatha
is said to have prevented his vomiting fire for a century by her
prayers. St. Philip ascended the same mountain, and with book and
candle pronounced a prayer of exorcism, at which three devils came out
like fiery flying stones, crying, &lsquo;Woe is us! we are still hunted
by Peter through Philip the Elder!&rsquo; The volcanoes originated the
belief that hell is at the earth&rsquo;s centre, and their busy Vulcans
of classic ages have been easily transformed into sulphurous lords of
the christian Hell. Such is the medi&aelig;val Haborym, demon of arson,
with his three heads&mdash;man, cat, and serpent&mdash;who rides
through the air mounted on a serpent, and bears in his hand a flaming
torch. The astrologers assigned him command of twenty-six legions of
demons in hell, and the superstitious often saw him laughing on the
roofs of burning houses.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2600src" href=
"#xd20e2600" name="xd20e2600src">13</a> But still more dignified is
Raum, who commands <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb75" href="#v1pb75"
name="v1pb75">75</a>]</span>thirty legions, and who destroys villages;
hence, also, concerned in the destructions of war, he became the demon
who awards dignities; and although this made his usual form of
apparition on the right bank of the Rhine that of the Odinistic raven,
on the left bank he may be detected in the little red man who was
reported as the familiar of Napoleon I. during his career.</p>
<p>Among Mr. Gill&rsquo;s South Pacific myths is one of a Prometheus,
Maui, who by assistance of a red pigeon gets from the subterranean
fire-demon the secret of producing fire (by rubbing sticks), the demon
(Mauike) being then consumed with his realm, and fire being brought to
the upper world to remain the friend of man. In Vedic legend, when the
world was enveloped in darkness, the gods prayed to Agni, who suddenly
burst out as Tvashtri&mdash;pure fire, the Vedic Vulcan&mdash;to the
dismay of the universe. In Eddaic sagas, Loki was deemed the most
voracious of beings until defeated in an eating match with Logi
(devouring fire).</p>
<p>Survivals of belief in the fiery nature of demons are very numerous.
Thus it is a very common belief that the Devil cannot touch or cross
water, and may therefore be escaped by leaping a stream. This has
sometimes been supposed to have something to do with the purifying
character of water; but there are many instances in Christian folklore
where the Devil is shown quite independent of even holy water if it is
not sprinkled on him or does not wet his feet. Thus in the Norfolk
legend concerning St. Godric, the Devil is said to have thrown the
vessel with its holy water at the saint&rsquo;s head out of anger at
his singing a canticle which the Virgin taught him. But when the Devil
attacked him in various ferocious animal shapes, St. Godric escaped by
running into the Wear, where he sometimes stood all night in water up
to his neck. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb76" href="#v1pb76" name=
"v1pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Kobolds get the red jackets they are said to wear from their
fiery nature. Originally the <i>lar familiaris</i> of Germany, the
Kobold became of many varieties; but in one line he has been developed
from the house-spirit, whose good or evil temper was recognised in the
comforts or dangers of fire, to a special Stone-demon. The hell-dog in
Faust&rsquo;s room takes refuge from the spell of
&lsquo;Solomon&rsquo;s Key&rsquo; behind the stone, and is there
transformed to human shape. The German maidens read many pretty oracles
in the behaviour of the fire, and the like in that of its fellow
<span lang="de">Wahrsager</span> the house-dog. It is indeed a
widespread notion that imps and witches lurk about the fireside,
obviously in cat and dog, and ride through the air on implements that
usually stand about the fire,&mdash;shovel, tongs, or broom. In Paris
it was formerly the custom to throw twenty-four cats into the fire on
St. John&rsquo;s night, the animals being, according to M. De Plancy,
emblems of the devil. So was replaced the holocaust of human witches,
until at last civilisation rang out its curfew for all such fires as
that. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb77" href="#v1pb77" name=

Infernal Queen, that she bids the Judge of her realm, Annunak, absolve
Ishtar from his golden throne.</p>

<p class="first">This old miracle-play of Nature&mdash;the return of
summer flower by flower&mdash;is deciphered from an ancient Assyrian
tablet in a town within only a few hours of another, where a circle of
worshippers repeat the same at every solstice! Myfyr Morganwg, the
Arch-Druid, adores still Hea by name as his Saviour, and at the winter
solstice assembles his brethren to celebrate his coming to bruise the
head of the Serpent of Hades (Annwn, nearly the same as in the tablet),
that seedtime and harvest shall not fail.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2653src" href="#xd20e2653" name="xd20e2653src">2</a></p>
<p>Is this a survival? No doubt; but there is no cult in the world
which, if &lsquo;scratched,&rsquo; as the proverb says, will not reveal
beneath it the same conception. However it may be spiritualised, every
&lsquo;plan of salvation&rsquo; is cast in the mould of Winter
conquered by the Sun, the Descent of Love to the Under World, the
delivery of the imprisoned germs of Life.</p>
<p>It is very instructive to compare with the myth of Ishtar that of
Herm&ouml;dr, seeking the release of Baldur the Beautiful from
Helheim.</p>
<p>The deadly powers of Winter are represented in the Eddaic account of
the death of Baldur, soft summer Light, the Norse Baal. His blind
brother H&ouml;dr is Darkness; the demon who directed his arrow is
Loki, subterranean fire; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb79" href=
"#v1pb79" name="v1pb79">79</a>]</span>the arrow itself is of mistletoe,
which, fostered by Winter, owes no duty to Baldur; and the realm to
which he is borne is that of Hel, the frozen zone. Herm&ouml;dr, having
arrived, assured Hel that the gods were in despair for the loss of
Baldur. The Queen replied that it should now be tried whether Baldur
was so beloved. &lsquo;If, therefore, all things in the world, both
living and lifeless, weep for him, he shall return to the
&AElig;sir.&rsquo; In the end all wept but the old hag Thokk
(Darkness), who from her cavern sang&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Thokk will wail</p>
<p class="line">With dry eyes</p>
<p class="line">Baldur&rsquo;s bale-fire.</p>
<p class="line">Nought quick or dead</p>
<p class="line">For Carl&rsquo;s son care I.</p>
<p class="line">Let Hel hold her own.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">So Baldur remained in Helheim. The myth very closely
resembles that of Ishtar&rsquo;s Descent. In similar accent the
messenger of the Southern gods weeps and lacerates himself as he
relates the grief of the upper world, and all men and animals
&lsquo;since the time that mother Ishtar descended into Hades.&rsquo;
But in the latter the messenger is successful, in the North he is
unsuccessful. In the corresponding myths of warm and sunny climes the
effort at release is more or less successful, in proportion to the
extent of winter. In Adonis released from Hades for four months every
year, and another four if he chose to abandon Persephone for Aphrodite,
we have a reflection of a variable year. That, and the similar myth of
Persephone, varied in the time specified for their passing in the upper
and under worlds, probably in accordance with the climatic averages of
the regions in which they were told. But in the tropics it was easy to
believe the release complete, as in the myth of Ishtar. In Mangaian
myths the hero, Maui, escapes from a nether world of fire, aided by a
red pigeon. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb80" href="#v1pb80" name=
"v1pb80">80</a>]</span></p>
<p>When this contest between Winter&rsquo;s Death and Spring&rsquo;s
Life became humanised, it was as Hercules vanquishing Death and
completely releasing Alcestis. When it became spiritualised it was as
Christ conquering Death and Hell, and releasing the spirits from
prison. The wintry desolation had to be artificially imitated in a
forty days&rsquo; fast and Lent, closing with a thrust from the spear
(the mistletoe arrow) amid darkness (blind H&ouml;dr). But the myth of
a swift resurrection had to be artificially preserved in the far North.
The legend of a full triumph over Death and Hell could never have
originated among our Norse ancestors. Their only story resembling it,
that of Iduna, related how her recovery from the Giants brought back
health to the gods, not men. But it was from the South that men had to
hear tidings of a rescue for the earth and man.</p>
<p>We cannot realise now what glad tidings were they which told this
new gospel to peoples sitting in regions of ice and gloom, after it had
been imposed on them against their reluctant fears. In manifold forms
the old combat was renewed in their festivals, and peoples who had long
been prostrate and helpless before the terrible powers of nature were
never weary of the Southern fables of heroic triumphs over them, long
interpreted in the simple physical sense.</p>
<p>The great Demon of the Northern World is still Winter, and the
hereditary hatred of him is such that he is still cursed, scourged,
killed, and buried or drowned under various names and disguises. In
every Slavonic country, says Mr. Ralston, there are to be found, about
carnival time, traces of ancient rites, intended to typify the death of
Winter and the birth of Spring or Summer. In Poland a puppet made of
hemp or straw is flung into a pond or swamp with the words, &lsquo;The
Devil take thee!&rsquo; Then the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb81"
href="#v1pb81" name="v1pb81">81</a>]</span>participators in the deed
scamper home, and if one of them stumbles and falls it is believed he
will die within the year. In Upper Lausatia a similar figure is
fastened on a pole to be pelted, then taken to the village boundary and
thrown across it or cast into the water, its bearers returning with
green boughs. Sometimes the figure is shrouded in white, representing
snow, and bears in its hands a broom (the sweeping storm) and a sickle
(the fatal reaper). In Russia the &lsquo;Straw Mujik&rsquo; is burned,
and also in Bulgaria; in the latter the bonfire is accompanied by the
firing of guns, and by dances and songs to Lado, goddess of Spring.
This reminiscence of Leto, on whose account Apollo slew the Python, is
rendered yet more striking by the week of archery which accompanies it,
recalling the sunbeam darts of the god. In Spain and Italy the demon
puppet is scourged under the name of Judas, as indeed is the case in
the annual Good Friday performance of Portuguese sailors in the London
Docks. Mr. Tylor found in Mexico a similar custom, the Judas being a
regular horned and hoofed devil. In Scotland the pre-christian
accessories of a corresponding custom are more pronounced both in the
time selected (the last day of the year, old style) and the place.
&lsquo;The Clavie,&rsquo; as the custom of burning the puppet of Winter
is mysteriously called, occurred on January 12 of this year (1878) at
Burghead, a fishing village near Forres, where stands an old Roman
altar locally named the &lsquo;Douro.&rsquo; A tar-barrel was set on
fire and carried by a fisherman round the town, while the people
shouted and hallooed. (If the man who carries the barrel falls it is an
evil omen.) The lighted barrel, having gone round the town, was carried
to the top of the hill and placed on the Douro. More fuel was added.
The sparks as they fly upwards are supposed to be witches and evil
spirits leaving the town; the people therefore shout at and curse
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb82" href="#v1pb82" name=
"v1pb82">82</a>]</span>them as they disappear in vacancy. When the
burning tar-barrel falls in pieces, the fishwomen rush in and endeavour
to get a lighted bit of wood from its remains; with this light the fire
on the cottage hearth is at once kindled, and it is considered lucky to
keep this flame alive all the rest of the year. The charcoal of the
Clavie is collected and put in bits up the chimney to prevent the
witches and evil spirits coming into the house. The Douro is covered
with a thick layer of tar from the fires that are annually lighted upon
it. Close to it is a very ancient Roman well.</p>
<p>It is an instance of the irony of etymology that the word
&lsquo;Hell&rsquo; means a place of fireless darkness. Nor is the fact
that the name of the Scandinavian demoness Hel, phonetically
corresponding with Kali, &lsquo;the Black One&rsquo; (Goth. Halja),
whose abode was an icy hole, has her name preserved as a place of fiery
torment, without significance. In regions where cold was known to an
uncomfortable extent as well as heat, we usually find it represented in
the ideas of future punishment. The realm called Hades, meaning just
the same as Hell, suggests cold. Tertullian and Jerome say that
Christ&rsquo;s own phrases &lsquo;outer darkness&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;gnashing (chattering) of teeth&rsquo; suggest a place of extreme
cold alternating with the excessive heat. Traces of similar
speculations are found with the Rabbins. Thus Rabbi Joseph says Gehenna
had both water and fire. Noah saw the angel of death approaching and
hid from him twelve months. Why twelve? Because (explains Rabbi Jehuda)
such is the trial of sinners,&mdash;six in water, six in fire. Dante
(following Virgil) has frigid as well as burning hells; and the idea
was refined by some scholiasts to a statement which would seem to make
the alternations of future punishment amount to a severe ague and
fever. Milton (Paradise Lost, ii.) has blended the rabbinical
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb83" href="#v1pb83" name=

satisfy his hunger. The Chenoos (demons) of the Mimacs of Nova Scotia
present certain features of the race-demons, but are fearfully cold.
The Chenoo weapon is a dragon&rsquo;s horn, his yell is fatal to the
hearer, his heart is a block of ice. This heart must be destroyed if
the demon is to be slain, but it can only be done by melting in the
fire: the chief precaution required is that one is not drowned in the
flood so caused. The icy demon survived long in Scotland. Sir James
Melville, in his &lsquo;Memoirs,&rsquo; says &lsquo;the spirit or devil
that helped the Scottish witches to raise a storm in the sea of Norway
was cold as ice and his body hard as iron; his face was terrible, his
nose like the beak of an eagle, great burning eyes, his hands and legs
hairy, with claws on his nails like a griffin.&rsquo; Dr. Fian was
burnt for raising this demon to oppose James I. on his stormy passage
from Denmark.</p>
<p>This type of demon haunted people&rsquo;s minds in Scandinavia,
where, though traditions of a flame demon (Loki) and the end of the
world by fire were imported, the popular belief seems to have been
mainly occupied with Frost giants, and the formidable Oegir, god of the
bleak sea east winds, preserved in our word awe (Anglo-Saxon
<i>ege</i>), and more directly in the name of our familiar demon, the
Ogre, so often slain in the child&rsquo;s Gladsheim. Loki (fire) was,
indeed, speedily relegated by the &AElig;sir (gods) to a hidden
subterraneous realm, where his existence could only be known by the
earthquakes, geysers, and Hecla eruptions which he occasioned. Yet he
was to come forth at Ragnar&ouml;k, the Twilight of the Gods. We can
see a singular blending of tropical and frigid zones&mdash;the one
traditional, the other native&mdash;in the Prose Edda.
Thus:&mdash;&lsquo;What will remain,&rsquo; said Gangler, &lsquo;after
heaven and earth and the whole universe shall be consumed, and after
all the gods and the homes of Valhalla and all mankind shall have

abodes,&rsquo; replied Thridi, &lsquo;some good, some bad. The best
place of all to be in will be Gimil, in heaven; and all who delight in
quaffing good drink will find a great store in the hall called Brimir,
which is also in heaven in the region Okolni. There is also a fair hall
of ruddy gold, (for) Sindri, which stands on the mountains of Nida. In
those halls righteous and well-minded men shall abide. In
N&aacute;-str&ouml;nd there is a vast and direful structure with doors
that face the north. It is formed entirely of the backs of serpents,
wattled together like wicker-work. But the serpents&rsquo; heads are
turned towards the inside of the hall, and continually vomit forth
floods of venom, in which wade all those who commit murder or who
forswear themselves. As it is said in the

(<i>g&iacute;mr</i>): Brimir (<i>br&iacute;mi</i>, flame), the giant,
and Sindri (<i>cinder</i>), the dwarf, jeweller of the gods, are raised
to halls of gold. Nothing is said of a garden, or walking therein
&lsquo;in the cool of the day.&rsquo; On the other hand,
N&aacute;-str&ouml;nd means Strand of the Dead, in that region whose
&lsquo;doors face the north,<a id="xd20e2789" name="xd20e2789"></a> far
from the sun,&rsquo; we behold an inferno of extreme <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb86" href="#v1pb86" name=
"v1pb86">86</a>]</span>cold. Christianity has not availed to give the
Icelanders any demonic name suggestive of fire. They speak of
&lsquo;Skratti&rsquo; (the roarer, perhaps our Old Scratch), and
&lsquo;Kolski&rsquo; (the coal black one), but promise nothing so
luminous and comfortable as fire or fire-fiend to the evil-doer.</p>
<p>In the great Epic of the <i lang="de">Nibelungen Lied</i> we have
probably the shape in which the Northman&rsquo;s dream of Paradise
finally cohered,&mdash;a Rose-garden in the South, guarded by a huge
Worm (water-snake, or glittering glacial sea intervening), whose
glowing charms, with Beauty (Chriemhild) for their queen, could be won
only by a brave dragon-slaying Siegfried. In passing by the pretty
lakeside home of Richard Wagner, on my way to witness the Ammergau
version of another dragon-binding and paradise-regaining legend, I
noted that the old name of the (Starnberg) lake was <i>Wurmsee</i>,
from the dragon that once haunted it, while from the composer&rsquo;s
window might be seen its &lsquo;Isle of Roses,&rsquo; which the dragon
guarded. Since then the myth of many forms has had its musical
apotheosis at Bayreuth under his wand.</p>
<p>England, partly perhaps on account of its harsh climate, once had
the reputation of being the chief abode of demons. A demoness leaving
her lover on the Continent says, &lsquo;My mother is calling me in
England.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2803src" href="#xd20e2803"
name="xd20e2803src">5</a> But England assigned them still higher
latitudes; in christianising Ireland, Iona, and other islands far
north, it was preliminary to expel the demons. &lsquo;The
Clavie,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Deis-iuil&rsquo; of Lewis and other Hebrides
islands&mdash;fire carried round cattle to defend them from demons, and
around mothers not yet churched, to keep the babes from being
&lsquo;changed&rsquo;&mdash;show that the expulsion still goes on,
though in such regions Norse and christian notions have become so
jumbled that it is &lsquo;fighting the devil with fire.&rsquo; So in
the Havamal men <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb87" href="#v1pb87"
name="v1pb87">87</a>]</span>are warned to invoke &lsquo;fire for
distempers;&rsquo; and Gudrun sings&mdash;</p>

<p class="line">The fire round my heart its sorrows melt.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The last line is in contrast with the Hindu saying,
&lsquo;the flame of her husband&rsquo;s pyre cools the widow&rsquo;s
breast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The characters of the Northern Heaven and Hell survive in the
English custom of burying the dead on the southern side of a church.
How widely this usage prevailed in Brand&rsquo;s time may be seen by
reference to his chapter on churchyards. The north side of the
graveyard was set apart for unbaptized infants and executed criminals,
and it was permitted the people to dance or play tennis in that part.
Dr. Lee says that in the churchyard at Morwenstow the southern portion
only contains graves, the north part being untenanted; as the Cornish
believe (following old traditions) that the north is the region of
demons. In some parishes of Cornwall when a baptism occurs the north
door of the nave opposite the font is thrown open, so that the devil
cast out may retire to his own region, the north.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2821src" href="#xd20e2821" name="xd20e2821src">6</a> This accords
with the saying in Martin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Month&rsquo;s
Mind&rsquo;&mdash;<i lang="la">ab aquilone omne malum</i>.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is not improbable that the fact noted by White, in his
&lsquo;History of Selborne,&rsquo; that &lsquo;the usual approach to
most country churches is by the south,&rsquo; indicated a belief that
the sacred edifice should turn its back on the region of demons. It is
a singular instance of survival which has brought about the fact that
people who listen devoutly to sermons describing the fiery character of
Satan and his abode should surround the very churches in which those
sermons are heard with evidences of their lingering <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb88" href="#v1pb88" name=
"v1pb88">88</a>]</span>faith that the devil belongs to the region of
ice, and that their dead must be buried in the direction of the happy
abodes of Brimir and Sindri,&mdash;Fire and Cinders!</p>
<p>M. Fran&ccedil;ois Lenormant has written an extremely instructive
chapter in comparison of the Accadian and the Finnish mythologies. He
there shows that they are as one and the same tree, adapted to
antagonistic climates.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2836src" href=
"#xd20e2836" name="xd20e2836src">7</a> With similar triad, runes,
charms, and even names in some cases, their regard for the fire
worshipped by both varies in a way that seems at first glance somewhat
anomalous. The Accadians in their fire-worship exhausted the resources
of praise in ascription of glory and power to the flames; the Finns in
their cold home celebrated the fire festival at the winter solstice,
uttered invocations over the fire, and the mother of the family, with
her domestic libation, said: &lsquo;Always rise so high, O my flame,
but burn not larger nor more ardent!&rsquo; This diminution of
enthusiasm in the Northern fire-worshipper, as compared with the
Southern, may only be the result of euphemism in the latter; or perhaps
while the formidable character of the fire-god among the primitive
Assyrians is indicated in the utter prostration before him
characteristic of their litanies and invocations, in the case of the
Finns the perpetual presence of the more potent cold led to the less
excessive adoration. These ventured to recognise the faults of
fire.</p>
<p>The true nature of this anomaly becomes visible when we consider
that the great demon, dreaded by the two countries drawing their cult
from a common source, represented the excess of the power most dreaded.
The demon in each case was a wind; among the Finns the north wind,
among the Accadians the south-west (the most fiery) wind. The Finnish
demon was Hiisi, speeding on his pale horse <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb89" href="#v1pb89" name=
"v1pb89">89</a>]</span>through the air, with a terrible train of
monster dogs, cats, furies, scattering pain, disease, and
death.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2846src" href="#xd20e2846" name=
"xd20e2846src">8</a> The Accadian demon, of which the bronze image is
in the Louvre, is the body of a dog, erect on eagle&rsquo;s feet, its
arms pointed with lion&rsquo;s paws; it has the tail of a scorpion and
the head of a skeleton, half stripped of flesh, preserving the eyes,
and mounted with the horns of a goat. It has four outspread wings. On
the back of this ingeniously horrible image is an inscription in the
Accadian language, apprising us that it is the demon of the south-west
wind, made to be placed at the door or window, to avert its hostile
action.</p>
<p>As we observe such figures as these on the one hand, and on the
other the fair beings imagined to be antagonistic to them; as we note
in runes and incantations how intensely the ancients felt themselves to
be surrounded by these good and evil powers, and, reading nature so,
learned to see in the seasons successively conquering and conquered by
each other, and alternation of longer days and longer nights, the
changing fortunes of a never-ending battle; we may better realise the
meaning of solstitial festivals, the customs that gathered around
Yuletide and New Year, and the manifold survivals from them which
annually masquerade in Christian costume and names. To our
sun-worshipping ancestor the new year meant the first faint advantage
of the warmer time over winter, as nearly as he could fix it. The
hovering of day between superiority of light and darkness is now named
after doubting Thomas. At Yuletide the dawning victory of the sun is
seen as a holy infant in a manger amid beasts of the stall. The old
nature-worship has bequeathed to christian belief a close-fitting
mantle. But the old idea of a war between the wintry and the warm
powers still haunts the period of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb90"
href="#v1pb90" name="v1pb90">90</a>]</span>the New Year; and the twelve
days and nights, once believed to be the period of a fiercely-contested
battle between good and evil demons, are still regarded by many as a
period for especial watchfulness and prayer. New Year&rsquo;s Eve, in
the north of England still &lsquo;Hogmanay,&rsquo;&mdash;probably O. N.
<i>h&ouml;ku-n&ouml;tt</i>, midwinter-night, when the sacrifices of
Thor were prepared,&mdash;formerly had many observances which reflected
the belief that good and evil ghosts were contending for every man and
woman: the air was believed to be swarming with them, and watch must be
kept to see that the protecting fire did not go out in any household;
that no strange man, woman, or animal approached,&mdash;possibly a
demon in disguise. Sacred plants were set in doors and windows to
prevent the entrance of any malevolent being from the multitudes
filling the air. John Wesley, whose noble heart was allied with a mind
strangely open to stories of hobgoblins, led the way of churches and
sects back into this ancient atmosphere. Nevertheless, the rationalism
of the age has influenced St. Wesley&rsquo;s Feast&mdash;Watchnight. It
can hardly recognise its brother in the Boar&rsquo;s Head Banquet of
Queen&rsquo;s College, Oxford, which celebrated victory over tusky
winter, the decapitated demon whose bristles were once icicles fallen
beneath the sylvan spirits of holly and rosemary. Yet what the
Watchnight really signifies in the antiquarian sense is just that old
culminating combat between the powers of fire and frost, once believed
to determine human fates. In White Russia, on New Year&rsquo;s Day,
when the annual elemental battle has been decided, the killed and
wounded on one hand, and the fortunate on the other, are told by
carrying from house to house the rich and the poor Kolyadas. These are
two children, one dressed in fine attire, and crowned with a wreath of
full ears of grain, the other ragged, and wearing a wreath of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb91" href="#v1pb91" name=
"v1pb91">91</a>]</span>threshed straw. These having been closely
covered, each householder is called in, and chooses one. If his choice
chances upon the &lsquo;poor Kolyada,&rsquo; the attending chorus chant
a mournful strain, in which he is warned to expect a bad harvest,
poverty, and perhaps death; if he selects the &lsquo;rich
Kolyada,&rsquo; a cheerful song is sung promising him harvest, health,
and wealth.</p>
<p>The natives of certain districts of Dardistan assign political and
social significance to their Feast of Fire, which is celebrated in the
month preceding winter, at new moon, just after their meat provision
for the season is laid in to dry. Their legend is, that it was then
their national hero slew their ancient tyrant and introduced good
government. This legend, related elsewhere, is of a tyrant slain
through the discovery that his heart was made of snow. He was slain by
the warmth of torches. In the celebrations all the men of the villages
go forth with torches, which they swing round their heads, and throw in
the direction of Ghilgit, where the snow-hearted tyrant so long held
his castle. When the husbands return home from their torch-throwing a
little drama is rehearsed. The wives refuse them entrance till they
have entreated, recounting the benefits they have brought them; after
admission the husband affects sulkiness, and must be brought round with
caresses to join in the banquet. The wife leads him forward with this
song:&mdash;&lsquo;Thou hast made me glad, thou favourite of the Rajah!
Thou hast rejoiced me, oh bold horseman! I am pleased with thee who so
well usest the gun and sword! Thou hast delighted me, oh thou invested
with a mantle of honours! Oh great happiness, I will buy it by giving
pleasure&rsquo;s price! Oh thou nourishment to us, heap of corn, store
of ghee&mdash;delighted will I buy it all by giving pleasure&rsquo;s
price!&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb92" href="#v1pb92"

<p class="first">During some recent years curious advertisements have
appeared in a journal of Edinburgh, calling for pious persons to occupy
certain hours of the night with holy exercises. It would appear that
they refer to a band of prayerful persons who provide that there shall
be an unbroken round of prayers during every moment of the day and
night. Their theory is, that it is the usual cessation of christian
prayers at night which causes so many disasters. The devils being then
less restrained, raise storms and all elemental perils. The praying
circle, which hopes to bind these demons by an uninterrupted chain of
prayers, originated, as I am informed, in the pious enthusiasm of a
lady whose kindly solicitude in some pre-existent sister was no doubt
personified in the Hindu Munasa, who, while all gods slept, sat in the
shape of a serpent on a branch of Euphorbia to preserve mankind from
the venom of snakes. It is to be feared, however, that it is hardly the
wisdom of the serpent which is on prayerful watch at Edinburgh, but
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb93" href="#v1pb93" name=
"v1pb93">93</a>]</span>rather a vigilance of that perilous kind which
was exercised by &lsquo;Meggie o&rsquo; the Shore,&rsquo; anno 1785, as
related by Hugh Miller.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2877src" href=
"#xd20e2877" name="xd20e2877src">1</a> On a boisterous night, when two
young girls had taken refuge in her cottage, they all heard about
midnight cries of distress mingling with the roar of the sea,
&lsquo;Raise the window curtain and look out,&rsquo; said Meggie. The
terrified girls did so, and said, &lsquo;There is a bright light in the
middle of the Bay of Udall. It hangs over the water about the height of
a ship&rsquo;s mast, and we can see something below it like a boat
riding at anchor, with the white sea raging around her.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Now drop the curtain,&rsquo; said Meggie; &lsquo;I am no
stranger, my lasses, to sights and noises like these&mdash;sights and
noises of another world; but I have been taught that God is nearer to
me than any spirit can be; and so have learned not to be afraid.&rsquo;
Afterwards it is not wonderful that a Cromarty yawl was discovered to
have foundered, and all on board to have been drowned; though
Meggie&rsquo;s neighbours seemed to have preserved the legend after her
faith, and made the scene described a premonition of what actually
occurred. It was in a region where mariners when becalmed invoke the
wind by whistling; and both the whistling and the praying, though their
prospects in the future may be slender, have had a long career in the
past.</p>
<p>In the &lsquo;Rig-Veda&rsquo; there is a remarkable hymn to Rudra
(the Roarer), which may be properly quoted here:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Sire of the storm gods, let thy favour extend to us; shut us not
out from the sight of the sun; may our hero be successful in the
onslaught. O Rudra, may we wax mighty in our offspring.</p>
<p>2. Through the assuaging remedies conferred by thee, O Rudra, may we
reach a hundred winters; drive away far from us hatred, distress, and
all-pervading diseases. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb94" href=
"#v1pb94" name="v1pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>3. Thou, O Rudra, art the most excellent of beings in glory, the
strongest of the strong, O wielder of the bolt; bear us safely through
evil to the further shore; ward off all the assaults of sin.</p>
<p>4. May we not provoke thee to anger, O Rudra, by our adorations,
neither through faultiness in praises, nor through wantonness in
invocations; lift up our heroes by thy remedies; thou art, I hear, the
chief physician among physicians.</p>
<p>5. May I propitiate with hymns this Rudra who is worshipped with
invocations and oblations; may the tender-hearted, easily-entreated,
tawny-haired, beautiful-chinned god not deliver us up to the plotter of
evil [literally, to the mind meditating &lsquo;I kill&rsquo;].</p>
<p>6. The bounteous giver, escorted by the storm-gods, hath gladdened
me, his suppliant, with most invigorating food; as one distressed by
heat seeketh the shade, may I, free from harm, find shelter in the
good-will of Rudra.</p>
<p>7. Where, O Rudra, is that gracious hand of thine, which is healing
and comforting? Do thou, removing the evil which cometh from the gods,
O bounteous giver, have mercy upon me.</p>
<p>8. To the tawny, the fair-complexioned dispenser of bounties, I send
forth a great and beautiful song of praise; adore the radiant god with
prostrations; we hymn the illustrious name of Rudra.</p>
<p>9. Sturdy-limbed, many-shaped, fierce, tawny, he hath decked himself
with brilliant ornaments of gold; truly strength is inseparable from
Rudra, the sovereign of this vast world.</p>
<p>10. Worthy of worship, thou bearest the arrows and the bow; worthy
of worship, thou wearest a resplendent necklace of many forms; worthy
of worship, thou rulest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb95" href=
"#v1pb95" name="v1pb95">95</a>]</span>over this immense universe; there
is none, O Rudra, mightier than thou.</p>
<p>11. Celebrate the renowned and ever-youthful god who is seated on a
chariot, who is, like a wild beast, terrible, fierce, and destructive;
have mercy upon the singer, O Rudra, when thou art praised; may thy
hosts strike down another than us.</p>
<p>12. As a boy saluteth his father who approacheth and speaketh to
him, so, O Rudra, I greet thee, the giver of much, the lord of the
good; grant us remedies when thou art praised.</p>
<p>13. Your remedies, O storm-gods, which are pure and helping, O
bounteous givers, which are joy-conferring, which our father Manu
chose, these and the blessing and succour of Rudra I crave.</p>
<p>14. May the dart of Rudra be turned aside from us, may the great
malevolence of the flaming-god be averted; unbend thy strong bow from
those who are liberal with their wealth; O generous god, have mercy
upon our offspring and our posterity (<i>i.e.</i>, our children and
children&rsquo;s children).</p>
<p>15. Thus, O tawny Rudra, wise giver of gifts, listen to our cry,
give heed to us here, that thou mayest not be angry with us, O god, nor
slay us; may we, rich in heroic sons, utter great praise at the
sacrifice.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2919src" href="#xd20e2919" name=
"xd20e2919src">2</a></p>
<p>In other hymns the malevolent character of Rudra is made still more
prominent:&mdash;</p>
<p>7. Slay not our strong man nor our little child, neither him who is
growing nor him who is grown, neither our father nor our mother; hurt
not, O Rudra, our dear selves.</p>
<p>8. Harm us not in our children and children&rsquo;s children, nor in
our men, nor in our kine, nor in our horses. Smite <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb96" href="#v1pb96" name=
"v1pb96">96</a>]</span>not our heroes in thy wrath; we wait upon thee
perpetually with offerings.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2931src" href=
"#xd20e2931" name="xd20e2931src">3</a></p>
<p>In this hymn (verse 1) Rudra is described as &lsquo;having braided
hair;&rsquo; and in the &lsquo;Yajur-veda&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;Atharva-veda&rsquo; other attributes of Siva are ascribed to
him, such as the epithet <i>n&icirc;la-gr&icirc;va</i>, or blue-necked.
In the &lsquo;Rig-veda&rsquo; Siva occurs frequently as an epithet, and
means <i>auspicious</i>. It was used as a euphemistic epithet to
appease Rudra, the lord of tempests; and finally, the epithet developed
into a distinct god.</p>
<p>The parentage of Siva is further indicated in the legends that his
glance destroyed the head of the youthful deity Ganesa, who now wears
the elephant head, with which it was replaced; and that the gods
persuaded him to keep his eyes perpetually winking (like
sheet-lightning), lest his concentrated look (the thunderbolt) should
reduce the universe to ashes. With the latter legend the gaze of the
evil eye in India might naturally be associated, though in the majority
of countries this was rather associated with the malign influences
ascribed to certain planets, especially Saturn; the charms against the
evil eye being marked over with zodiacal signs. The very myth of
Siva&rsquo;s eye survives in the Russian demon Magarko
(&lsquo;Winker&rsquo;) and the Servian Vii, whose glance is said to
have power to reduce men, and even cities, to ashes.</p>
<p>The terrible Rudra is represented in a vast number of beliefs, some
of them perhaps survivals; in the rough sea and east-wind demon Oegir
of the northern world, and Typhon in the south; and in Luther&rsquo;s
faith that &lsquo;devils do house in the dense black clouds, and send
storms, hail, thunder and lightning, and poison the air with their
infernal stench,&rsquo; a doctrine which Burton, the Anatomist of
Melancholy, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb97" href="#v1pb97" name=
"v1pb97">97</a>]</span>too, maintained against the meteorologists of
his time.</p>
<p>Among the ancient Aryans lightning seems to have been the supreme
type of divine destructiveness. Rudra&rsquo;s dart, Siva&rsquo;s eye,
reappear with the Singhalese prince of demons Wessamonny, described as
wielding a golden sword, which, when he is angry, flies out of his
hand, to which it spontaneously returns, after cutting off a thousand
heads.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2950src" href="#xd20e2950" name=
"xd20e2950src">4</a> A wonderful spear was borne by Odin, and was
possibly the original Excalibur. The four-faced Sviatevit of Russia,
whose mantle has fallen to St. George, whose statue was found at Zbrucz
in 1851, bore a horn of wine (rain) and a sword (lightning).</p>
<p>In Greece similar swords were wielded by Zeus, and also by the god
of war. Through Zeus and Ares, the original wielders of the
lightning&mdash;Indra and Siva&mdash;became types of many gods and
semi-divine heroes. The evil eye of Siva glared from the forehead of
the Cyclopes, forgers of thunderbolts; and the saving disc of Indra
flashed in the swords and arrows of famous
dragon-slayers&mdash;Perseus, Pegasus, Hercules, and St. George. The
same sword defended the Tree of Life in Eden, and was borne in the hand
of Death on the Pale Horse (a white horse was sacrificed to Sviatevit
in Russia within christian times). And, finally, we have the wonderful
sword which obeys the command &lsquo;Heads off!&rsquo; delighting all
nurseries by the service it does to the King of the Golden
Mountain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beheld Satan as lightning falling out of heaven.&rsquo; To
the Greeks this falling of rebellious deities out of heaven accounted,
as we have seen explained, for their lameness. But a universal
phenomenon can alone account for the many demons with crooked or
crippled legs (like &lsquo;Diable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb98"
href="#v1pb98" name="v1pb98">98</a>]</span>Boiteux&rsquo;)<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e2959src" href="#xd20e2959" name="xd20e2959src">5</a>
all around the world. The Namaquas of South Africa have a
&lsquo;deity&rsquo; whose occupation it is to cause pain and death; his
name is Tsui&rsquo;knap, that is &lsquo;wounded knee.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e2965src" href="#xd20e2965" name="xd20e2965src">6</a>
Livingstone says of the Bakwains, another people of South Africa,
&lsquo;It is curious that in all their pretended dreams or visions of
their god he has always a crooked leg, like the Egyptian
Thau.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2968src" href="#xd20e2968"
name="xd20e2968src">7</a> In Mainas, South America, they believe in a
treacherous demon, Uchuella-chaqui, or Lame-foot, who in dark forests
puts on a friendly shape to lure Indians to destruction; but the
huntsmen say they can never be deceived if they examine this
demon&rsquo;s foot-track, because of the unequal size of the two
feet.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2971src" href="#xd20e2971" name=
"xd20e2971src">8</a> The native Australians believed in a demon named
Biam; he is black and deformed in his lower extremities; they
attributed to him many of their songs and dances, but also a sort of
small-pox to which they were liable.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2978src" href="#xd20e2978" name="xd20e2978src">9</a> We have no
evidence that these superstitions migrated from a common centre; and
there can be little doubt that many of these crooked legs are traceable
to the crooked lightning.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2981src" href=
"#xd20e2981" name="xd20e2981src">10</a> At the same time this is by no
means inconsistent with what has been already said of the fall of
Titans and angels from heaven as often accounting for their lameness in
popular myths. But in such details it is hard to reach certainty, since
so many of the facts bear a suspicious resemblance to each other. A
wild boar with &lsquo;distorted legs&rsquo; attacked St. Godric, and
the temptation is strong to generalise on the story, but the legs
probably mean only to certify that it was the devil.</p>
<p>Dr. Schliemann has unearthed among his other treasures the
remarkable fact that a temple of Helios (the sun) once stood near the
site of the present Church of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb99"
href="#v1pb99" name="v1pb99">99</a>]</span>Elias, at Mycen&aelig;,
which has from time immemorial been the place to which people repair to
pray for rain.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2988src" href="#xd20e2988"
name="xd20e2988src">11</a> When the storm-breeding Sun was succeeded by
the Prophet whose prayer evoked the cloud, even the name of the latter
did not need to be changed. The discovery is the more interesting
because it has always been a part of the christian folklore of that
region that, when a storm with lightning occurs, it is &lsquo;Elias in
his chariot of fire.&rsquo; A similar phrase is used in some part of
every Aryan country, with variation of the name: it is Woden, or King
Waldemar, or the Grand Veneur, or sometimes God, who is said to be
going forth in his chariot.</p>
<p>These storm-demons in their chariots have their forerunner in Vata
or Vayu, the subject of one of the most beautiful Vedic hymns. &lsquo;I
celebrate the glory of Vata&rsquo;s chariot; its noise comes rending
and resounding. Touching the sky he moves onward, making all things
ruddy; and he comes propelling the dust of the earth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Soul of the gods, source of the universe, this deity moves as
he lists. His sounds have been heard, but his form is not seen; this
Vata let us worship with an oblation.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2998src" href="#xd20e2998" name="xd20e2998src">12</a></p>
<p>This last verse, as Mr. Muir has pointed out, bears a startling
resemblance to the passage in John, &lsquo;The Wind bloweth where it
listeth, and thou canst not tell whence it cometh or whither it goeth;
so is every one that is born of the Wind.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e3003src" href="#xd20e3003" name="xd20e3003src">13</a></p>
<p>But an equally striking development of the Vedic idea is represented
in the Siamese legend of Buddha, and in this case the Vedic Wind-god
Vayu reappears by name for the Angels of Tempests, or Loka Phayu. The
first <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb100" href="#v1pb100" name=
"v1pb100">100</a>]</span>portent which preceded the descent of Buddha
from the Tushita heavens was &lsquo;when the Angels of the Tempest,
clothed in red garments, and with streaming hair, travel among the
abodes of mankind crying, &lsquo;Attend all ye who are near to death;
repent and be not heedless! The end of the world approaches, but one
hundred thousand years more and it will be destroyed. Exert yourselves,
then, exert yourselves to acquire merit. Above all things be
charitable; abstain from doing evil; meditate with love to all beings,
and listen to the teachings of holiness. For we are all in the mouth of
the king of death. Strive then earnestly for meritorious fruits, and
seek that which is good.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3013src"
href="#xd20e3013" name="xd20e3013src">14</a></p>
<p>Not less remarkable is the Targum of Jonathan Ben Uzziel to 1 Kings
xix., where around Elias on the mountain gather &lsquo;a host of angels
of the wind, cleaving the mountain and breaking the rocks before the
Lord;&rsquo; and after these, &lsquo;angels of commotion,&rsquo; and
next &lsquo;of fire,&rsquo; and, finally, &lsquo;voices singing in
silence&rsquo; preceded the descent of Jehovah. It can hardly be
wondered that a prophet of whom this story was told, and that of the
storm evoked from a small cloud, should be caught up into that chariot
of the Vedic Vayu which has rolled on through all the ages of
mythology.</p>
<p>Mythologic streams seem to keep their channels almost as steadfastly
as rivers, but as even these change at last or blend, so do the old
traditions. Thus we find that while Thor and Odin remain as separate in
survivals as Vayu and Parjanya in India, in Russia Elias has inherited
not the mantle of the wind-god or storm-breeding sun, but of the
Slavonic Thunderer Perun. There is little doubt that this is Parjanya,
described in the &lsquo;Rig-Veda&rsquo; as &lsquo;the thunderer, the
showerer, the bountiful,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3020src"
href="#xd20e3020" name="xd20e3020src">15</a> who &lsquo;strikes down
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb101" href="#v1pb101" name=
"v1pb101">101</a>]</span>trees&rsquo; and &lsquo;the wicked.&rsquo;
&lsquo;The people of Novgorod,&rsquo; says Herberstein, &lsquo;formerly
offered their chief worship and adoration to a certain idol named
Perun. When subsequently they received baptism they removed it from its
place, and threw it into the river Volchov; and the story goes that it
swam against the stream, and that near the bridge a voice was heard
saying, &lsquo;This for you, O inhabitants of Novgorod, in memory of
me;&rsquo; and at the same time a certain rope was thrown upon the
bridge. Even now it happens from time to time on certain days of the
year that this voice of Perun may be heard, and on these occasions the
citizens run together and lash each other with ropes, and such a tumult
arises <span class="corr" id="xd20e3025" title=
"Source: thereform">therefrom</span> that all the efforts of the
governor can scarcely assuage it.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e3028src" href="#xd20e3028" name="xd20e3028src">16</a> The statue
of Perun in Kief, says Mr. Ralston, had a trunk of wood, while the head
was of silver, with moustaches of gold, and among its weapons was a
mace. Afanasief states that in White-Russian traditions Perun is tall
and well-shaped, with black hair and a long golden beard. This beard
relates him to Barbarossa, and, perhaps, though distantly, with the
wood-demon Barbatos, the Wild Archer, who divined by the songs of
birds.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3031src" href="#xd20e3031" name=
"xd20e3031src">17</a> Perun also has a bow which is &lsquo;sometimes
identified with the rainbow, an idea which is known also to the Finns.
From it, according to the White Russians, are shot burning arrows,
which set on fire all things that they touch. In many parts of Russia
(as well as of Germany) it is supposed that these bolts sink deep into
the soil, but that at the end of three or seven years they return to
the surface in the shape of longish stones of a black or dark grey
colour&mdash;probably belemnites, or masses of fused sand&mdash;which
are called thunderbolts, and considered as excellent preservations
against lightning and conflagrations. The Finns call them <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb102" href="#v1pb102" name=
"v1pb102">102</a>]</span>Ukonkiwi&mdash;the stone of thunder-god Ukko,
and in Courland their name is Perkuhnsteine, which explains itself. In
some cases the flaming dart of Perun became, in the imagination of the
people, a golden key. With it he unlocked the earth, and brought to
light its concealed treasures, its restrained waters, its captive
founts of light. With it also he locked away in safety fugitives who
wished to be put out of the power of malignant conjurors, and performed
various other good offices. Appeals to him to exercise these functions
still exist in the spells used by the peasants, but his name has given
way to that of some christian personage. In one of them, for instance,
the Archangel Michael is called upon to secure the invoker behind an
iron door fastened by twenty-seven locks, the keys of which are given
to the angels to be carried to heaven. In another, John the Baptist is
represented as standing upon a stone in the Holy Sea [<i>i.e.</i>, in
heaven], resting upon an iron crook or staff, and is called upon to
stay the flow of blood from a wound, locking the invoker&rsquo;s veins
&lsquo;with his heavenly key.&rsquo; In this case the myth has passed
into a rite. In order to stay a violent bleeding from the nose, a
locked padlock is brought, and the blood is allowed to drop through its
aperture, or the sufferer grasps a key in each hand, either plan being
expected to prove efficacious. As far as the key is concerned, the
belief seems to be still maintained among ourselves.&rsquo;<a class=

<p>The Key has a holy sense in various religions, and consequently an
infernal key is its natural counterpart. The Vedic hymns, which say so
much about the shutting and opening, imprisoning and releasing, of
heavenly rains and earthly fruits by demons and deities, interpret many
phenomena of nature, and the same ideas have arisen in many lands. We
cannot be certain, therefore, that Calmet <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb103" href="#v1pb103" name="v1pb103">103</a>]</span>is right in
assigning an Indian origin to the subjoined Figure 5, an ancient
Persian medal. The signs of the zodiac on its body show it to be one of
those celestial demons believed able to bind the beneficent or loose
the formidable powers of nature. The Key is of especial import in
Hebrew faith. It was the high-priest Eliakim&rsquo;s symbol of office,
as being also prefect in the king&rsquo;s house. &lsquo;The key of the
house of David will I lay upon his shoulder: he shall open and none
shall shut; he shall shut and none shall open.&rsquo;<a class="noteref"

<p>The ubiquitous superstition which attributes the flint arrows of
pre-historic races to gods, shot by them as lightning, and, as some
said, from a rainbow, is too childlike a theory to call for elaborate
treatment. We need not, ethnographically, connect our &lsquo;Thor
arrows&rsquo; and &lsquo;Elf shots&rsquo; with the stones hurled at
mortals by the Thunder-Duke (Lui-tsz) of China. The ancient Parthians,
who used to reply to the thunderstorm by shooting arrows at it, and the
Turks, who attack an eclipse with guns, fairly represent the infancy of
the human race, though perhaps with more than its average pluck. Dr.
Macgowan relates, concerning the Lei-chau (Thunder District) of China,
various myths which resemble those which surround the world. After
thunderstorms, black stones, it is believed, may be found which emit
light and peculiar sounds on being struck. In a temple consecrated to
the Thunder Duke the people annually place a drum for that stormy demon
to beat. The drum was formerly left on a mountain-top with a little boy
as a sacrifice.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3069src" href="#xd20e3069"

name="v1pb105">105</a>]</span>the same country that violent winds and
typhoons are caused by the passage through the air of the
&lsquo;Bob-tailed Dragon,&rsquo; and also of the rain-god
Y&uuml;-Sh&uuml;h. A storm-god connected with the &lsquo;Eagre,&rsquo;
or bore of the river Tsien-tang, presents a coincidence of name with
the Scandinavian Oegir, which would be hardly noticeable were it not
for the very close resemblance between the folklore concerning the
&lsquo;Bob-tailed Dragon&rsquo; and the storm-dragons of several Aryan
races. Generally, in both China and Japan the Dragon is regarded with a
veneration equal to the horror with which the serpent is visited. Of
this phenomenon and its analogies in Britain I shall have an
explanation to submit when we come to consider Dragon-myths more
particularly. To this general rule the &lsquo;Bob-tailed Dragon&rsquo;
of China is a partial exception. His fidelity as a friend led to the
ill return of an attack by which his tail was amputated, and ever since
his soured temper has shown itself in raising storms. When a violent
tempest arises the Cantonese say, &lsquo;The Bob-tailed Dragon is
passing,&rsquo; in the same proverbial way as the Aryan peasantries
attribute the same phenomenon to their storm-gods.</p>
<p>The notion is widely prevalent in some districts of France that all
whirlwinds, however slight, are caused by wizards or witches, who are
in them, careering through the air; and it is stated by the
<i>Melusine</i> that in the department of the Orne storms are
attributed to the clergy, who are supposed to be circling in them. The
same excellent journal states that some years ago, in that department,
a parishioner who saw his crops threatened by a hail-storm fired into
the cloud. The next day he heard that the parish priest had broken his
leg by a fall for which he could not account.</p>
<p>The following examples are given by Kuhn. Near Stangenhagen is a
treasure hid in a mountain which Lord <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb106" href="#v1pb106" name="v1pb106">106</a>]</span>von Th&uuml;men
tried to seek, but was caught up with his horse by a whirlwind and
deposited at home again. The Devil is believed to be seated at the
centre of every whirlwind. At Biesenthal it is said a noble lady became
the Wind&rsquo;s bride. She was in her time a famous rider and
huntress, who rode recklessly over farmers&rsquo; fields and gardens;
now she is herself hunted by snakes and dragons, and may be heard
howling in every storm.</p>
<p>I suspect that the bristling hair so frequently portrayed in the
Japanese Oni, Devils, refers to their frequent residence at the centre
of a gale of wind. Their demon of the storm is generally pictured
throned upon a flower of flames, his upraised and extended fingers
emitting the most terrific lightnings, which fall upon his victims and
envelop them in flames. Sometimes, however, the Japanese artists poke
fun at their thunder-god, and show him sprawling on the ground from the
recoil of his own lightnings. The following extract from <i>The
Christian Herald</i> (London, April 12, 1877) will show how far the
dread of this Japanese Oni extends: &lsquo;A pious father writes,
&lsquo;A few days ago there was a severe thunderstorm, which seemed to
gather very heavily in the direction where my son lived; and I had a
feeling that I must go and pray that he might be protected, and not be
killed by the lightning. The impression seemed to say, &lsquo;There is
no time to be lost.&rsquo; I obeyed, and went and knelt down and prayed
that the Lord would spare his life. I believe he heard my prayer. My
son called on me afterwards, and, speaking of the shower, said,
&lsquo;The lightning came downwards and struck the very hoe in my
hands, and numbed me.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Perhaps you would have been
killed if some one had not been praying for you.&rsquo; Since then he
has been converted, and, I trust, will be saved in God&rsquo;s
everlasting kingdom.&rsquo;<span class="corr" id="xd20e3094" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>Such paragraphs may now strike even many christians <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb107" href="#v1pb107" name=
"v1pb107">107</a>]</span>as &lsquo;survivals.&rsquo; But it is not so
very long since some eminent clergymen looked upon Benjamin Franklin as
the heaven-defying Ajax of Christendom, because he undertook to show
people how they might divert the lightnings from their habitations. In
those days Franklin personally visited a church at Streatham, whose
steeple had been struck by lightning, and, after observing the region,
gave an opinion that if the steeple were again erected without a
lightning-rod, it would again be struck. The audacious man who
&lsquo;snatched sceptres from tyrants and lightnings from
heaven,&rsquo; as the proverb ran, was not listened to: the steeple was
rebuilt, and again demolished by lightning.</p>
<p>The supreme god of the Quichuas (American), <span class="corr" id=
"xd20e3103" title="Source: Viracvcha">Viracocha</span> (&lsquo;sea
foam&rsquo;), rises out of Lake Titicaca, and journeys with lightnings
for all opposers, to disappear in the Western Ocean. The Quichua is
mentally brother of the Arab camel-driver. &lsquo;The sea,&rsquo; it is
said in the &lsquo;Arabian Nights,&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;the sea became
troubled before them, and there arose from it a black pillar, ascending
towards the sky, and approaching the meadow,&rsquo; and &lsquo;behold
it was a Jinn<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3106src" href="#xd20e3106"
name="xd20e3106src">23</a> of gigantic stature.&rsquo; The Jinn is
sometimes helpful as it is formidable; it repays the fisherman who
unseals it from the casket fished up from the sea, as fruitfulness
comes out of the cloud no larger than a man&rsquo;s hand evoked by
Elijah. The perilous Jinn described in the above extract is the
waterspout. Waterspouts are attributed in China to the battles of
dragons in the air, and the same country recognises a demon of high
tides. The newest goddess in China is a canonised protectress against
the shipwrecking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb108" href="#v1pb108"
name="v1pb108">108</a>]</span>storm-demons of the coast, an exaltation
recently proclaimed by the Government of the empire in obedience, as
the edict stated, to the belief prevailing among sailors. In this the
Chinese are a long way behind the mariners and fishermen of the French
coast, who have for centuries, by a pious philology, connected
&lsquo;Maria&rsquo; with &lsquo;La Mar&eacute;e&rsquo; and &lsquo;La
Mer;&rsquo; and whenever they have been saved from storms, bring their
votive offerings to sea-side shrines of the Star of the Sea.</p>
<p>The old Jewish theology, in its eagerness to claim for Jehovah the
absolutism which would make him &lsquo;Lord of lords,&rsquo; instituted
his responsibility for many doubtful performances, the burthen of which
is now escaped by the device of saying that he &lsquo;permitted&rsquo;
them. In this way the Elohim who brought on the Deluge have been
identified with Jehovah. None the less must we see in the biblical
account of the Flood the action of tempestuous water-demons. What power
a christian would recognise in such an event were it related in the
sacred books of another religion may be seen in the vision of the
Apocalypse&mdash;&lsquo;The Serpent cast out of his mouth a flood of
water after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away with
the flood; and the earth helped the woman and opened its mouth and
swallowed up the flood.&rsquo; This Demon of Inundation meets the
explorer of Egyptian and Accadian inscriptions at every turn. The
terrible Seven, whom even the God of Fire cannot control, &lsquo;break

"v1pb109">109</a>]</span>dates about B.C. 1600, we have the continual
association of eclipse and flood: &lsquo;On the fifteenth day an
eclipse takes place. The king dies; and rains in the heaven, floods in
the channels are.&rsquo; &lsquo;In the month of Elul (August), the
fourteenth day, an eclipse takes place.... Northward ... its shadow is
seen; and to the King of Mullias a crown is given. To the king the
crown is an omen; and over the king the eclipse passes. Rains in
heaven, floods in the channels flow. A famine is in the country. Men
their sons for silver sell.&rsquo; &lsquo;After a year the Air-god
inundates.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3129src" href="#xd20e3129"

<p>In the Chald&aelig;o-Babylonian cosmogony the three zones of the
universe were ruled over by a Triad as follows: the Heaven by Anu; the
surface of the earth, including the atmosphere, by Bel; the under-world
by Nouah.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3134src" href="#xd20e3134" name=
"xd20e3134src">28</a> This same Nouah is the Assyrian Hea or Saviour;
and it is Noah of the Bible. The name means a rest or
residence,&mdash;the place where man may dwell. When Tiamat the Dragon,
or the Leviathan, opens &lsquo;the fountains of the great deep,&rsquo;
and Anu &lsquo;the windows of Heaven,&rsquo; it is Hea or Noah who
saves the life of man. M. Fran&ccedil;ois Lenormant has shown this to
be the probable sense of one of the most ancient Accadian fragments in
the British Museum. In it allusion is made to &lsquo;the serpent of

<p>The Hydra may be taken as a type of the destructive water-demon in a
double sense, for its heads remain in many mythical forms. The Syrian
Dagon and Atergatis, fish-deities, have bequeathed but their element to
our <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb111" href="#v1pb111" name=
"v1pb111">111</a>]</span>Undines of romance. Some nymphs have so long
been detached from aqueous associations as to have made their names
puzzling, and their place in demonology more so. To the Nixy
(<span class="trans" title="n&#275;ch&#333;"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&nu;&#8053;&chi;&omega;</span></span>) of Germany, now merely
mischievous like the British Pixy, many philologists trace the common
phrase for the Devil,&mdash;&lsquo;Old Nick.&rsquo; I believe, however,
that this phrase owes its popularity to St. Nicholas rather than to the
Norse water-god whose place he was assigned after the christian
accession. This saintly Poseidon, who, from being the patron of
fishermen, gradually became associated with that demon whom, Sir Walter
Scott said, &lsquo;the British sailor feared when he feared nothing
else,&rsquo; was also of old the patron of pirates; and robbers were
called &lsquo;St. Nicholas&rsquo; clerks.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e3231src" href="#xd20e3231" name="xd20e3231src">33</a> In Norway
and the Netherlands the ancient belief in the demon Nikke was strong;
he was a kind of Wild Huntsman of the Sea, and has left many legends,
of which &lsquo;The Flying Dutchman&rsquo; is one. But my belief is
that, through his legendary relation to boys, St. Nicholas gave the
name Old Nick its modern moral accent. Because of his reputation for
having restored to life three murdered children St. Nicholas was made
their patron, and on his day, December 6, it was the old custom to
consecrate a Boy-Bishop, who held office until the 28th of the month.
By this means he became the moral appendage of the old Wodan god of the
Germanic races, who was believed in winter time to find shelter in and
shower benefits from evergreens, especially firs, on his favourite
children who happened to wander beneath them. &lsquo;Bartel,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Klaubauf,&rsquo; or whatever he might be called, was reduced to
be the servant of St. Nicholas, whose name is now jumbled into
&lsquo;Santaclaus.&rsquo; According to the old custom he appeared
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb112" href="#v1pb112" name=
"v1pb112">112</a>]</span>attended by his Knecht
Klaubauf&mdash;personated by those who knew all about the
children&mdash;bringing a sort of doomsday. The gifts having been
bestowed on the good children, St. Nicholas then ordered Klaubauf to
put the naughty ones into his pannier and carry them off for
punishment. The terror and shrieks thus caused have created vast misery
among children, and in Munich and some other places the authorities
have very properly made such tragedies illegal. But for many centuries
it was the custom of nurses and mothers to threaten refractory children
with being carried off at the end of the year by Nicholas; and in this
way each year closed, in the young apprehension, with a Judgment Day, a
Weighing of Souls, and a Devil or Old Nick as agent of retribution.</p>
<p>Nick has long since lost his aquatic character, and we find his name
in the Far West (America) turning up as &lsquo;The Nick of the
Woods,&rsquo;&mdash;the wild legend of a settler who, following a vow
of vengeance for his wrongs, used to kill the red men while they slept,
and was supposed to be a demon. The Japanese have a
water-dragon&mdash;Kappa&mdash;of a retributive and moral kind, whose
office it is to swallow bad boys who go to swim in disobedience to
their parents&rsquo; commands, or at improper times and places. It is
not improbable that such dangers to the young originated some of the
water-demons,&mdash;probably such as are thought of as diminutive and
mischievous,&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Nixies. The Nixa was for a long time on
the Baltic coast the female &lsquo;Old Nick,&rsquo; and much feared by
fishermen. Her malign disposition is represented in the Kelpie of
Scotland,&mdash;a water-horse, believed to carry away the unwary by
sudden floods to devour them. In Germany there was a river-goddess
whose temple stood at Magdeburg, whence its name. A legend exists of
her having appeared in the market there in christian costume, but she
was detected by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb113" href="#v1pb113"
name="v1pb113">113</a>]</span>a continual dripping of water from the
corner of her apron. In Germany the Nixies generally played the part of
the naiads of ancient times.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3246src" href=
"#xd20e3246" name="xd20e3246src">34</a> In Russia similar beings,
called Rusalkas, are much more formidable.</p>
<p>In many regions of Christendom it is related that these demons,
relatives of the Swan-maidens, considered in another chapter, have been
converted into friendly or even pious creatures, and baptized into
saintly names. Sometimes there are legends which reveal this
transition. Thus it is related that in the year 1440, the dikes of
Holland being broken down by a violent tempest, the sea overflowed the
meadows; and some maidens of the town of Edam, in West Friesland, going
in a boat to milk their cows, espied a mermaid embarrassed in the mud,
the waters being very shallow. They took it into their boat and brought
it to Edam, and dressed it in women&rsquo;s apparel, and taught it to
spin. It ate as they did, but could not be brought to speak. It was
carried to Haarlem, where it lived for some years, though showing an
inclination to water. Parival, who tells the story, relates that they
had conveyed to it some notions of the existence of a deity, and it
made its reverences devoutly whenever it passed a crucifix.</p>
<p>Another creature of the same species was in the year 1531 caught in
the Baltic, and sent as a present to Sigismund, King of Poland. It was
seen by all the persons about the court, but only lived three days.</p>

<p>The once perilous Strudel and Wirbel of the Danube are haunted by
diabolical legends. From Dr. William Beattie&rsquo;s admirable work on
&lsquo;The Danube&rsquo; I quote the following
passages:&mdash;&lsquo;After descending the Greinerschwall, or rapids
of Grein above mentioned, the river rolls on for a considerable space,
in a deep and almost tranquil volume, which, by contrast with the
approaching turmoil, gives increased effect to its wild, stormy, and
romantic features. At first a hollow, subdued roar, like that of
distant thunder, strikes the ear and rouses the traveller&rsquo;s
attention. This increases every second, and the stir and activity which
now prevail among the hands on board show that additional force,
vigilance, and caution are to be employed in the use of the helm and
oars. The water is now changed in its colour&mdash;chafed into foam,
and agitated like a seething cauldron. In front, and in the centre of
the channel, rises an abrupt, isolated, and colossal rock, fringed with
wood, and crested with a mouldering tower, on the summit of which is
planted a lofty cross, to which in the moment of danger the ancient
boatmen were wont to address their prayers for deliverance. The first
sight of this used to create no little excitement and apprehension on
board; the master ordered strict silence to be observed, the steersman
grasped the helm with a firmer hand, the passengers moved aside, so as
to leave free space for the boatmen, while the women and children were
hurried into the cabin, there to await, with feelings of no little
anxiety, the result of the enterprise. Every boatman, with his head
uncovered, muttered a prayer to his patron saint; and away dashed the
barge through the tumbling breakers, that seemed as if hurrying it on
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb116" href="#v1pb116" name=
"v1pb116">116</a>]</span>inevitable destruction. All these
preparations, joined by the wildness of the adjacent scenery, the
terrific aspect of the rocks, and the tempestuous state of the water,
were sufficient to produce a powerful sensation on the minds even of
those who had been all their lives familiar with dangers; while the
shadowy phantoms with which superstition had peopled it threw a deeper
gloom over the whole scene.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the whirlpool called Wirbel, and the surrounding ruins,
the same author writes: &lsquo;Each of these mouldering fortresses was
the subject of some miraculous tradition, which circulated at every
hearth. The sombre and mysterious aspect of the place, its wild
scenery, and the frequent accidents which occurred in the passage,
invested it with awe and terror; but above all, the superstitions of
the time, a belief in the marvellous, and the credulity of the boatmen,
made the navigation of the Strudel and the Wirbel a theme of the
wildest romance. At night, sounds that were heard far above the roar of
the Danube issued from every ruin. Magical lights flashed through their
loopholes and casements, festivals were held in the long-deserted
halls, maskers glided from room to room, the waltzers maddened to the
strains of an infernal orchestra, armed sentinels paraded the
battlements, while at intervals the clash of arms, the neighing of
steeds, and the shrieks of unearthly combatants smote fitfully on the
boatmen&rsquo;s ear. But the tower on which these scenes were most
fearfully enacted was that on the Longstone, commonly called the
&lsquo;Devil&rsquo;s Tower,&rsquo; as it well deserved to be&mdash;for
here, in close communion with his master, resided the &lsquo;Black
Monk,&rsquo; whose office it was to exhibit false lights and landmarks
along the gulf, so as to decoy the vessels into the whirlpool, or dash
them against the rocks. He was considerably annoyed in his quarters,
however, on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb117" href="#v1pb117"
name="v1pb117">117</a>]</span>the arrival of the great Soliman in these
regions; for to repel the turbaned host, or at least to check their
triumphant progress to the Upper Danube, the inhabitants were summoned
to join the national standard, and each to defend his own hearth.
Fortifications were suddenly thrown up, even churches and other
religious edifices were placed in a state of military defence; women
and children, the aged and the sick, as already mentioned in our notice
of Schaumburg, were lodged in fortresses, and thus secured from the
violence of the approaching Moslem. Among the other points at which the
greatest efforts were made to check the enemy, the passage of the
Strudel and Wirbel was rendered as impregnable as the time and
circumstances of the case would allow. To supply materials for the
work, patriotism for a time got the better of superstition, and the
said Devil&rsquo;s Tower was demolished and converted into a strong
breastwork. Thus forcibly dislodged, the Black Monk is said to have
pronounced a malediction on the intruders, and to have chosen a new
haunt among the recesses of the Harz mountains.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the glaciers send down their torrents and flood the Rhone, it
is the immemorial belief that the Devil may be sometimes seen swimming
in it, with a sword in one hand and a golden globe in the other. Since
it is contrary to all orthodox folklore that the Devil should be so
friendly with water, the name must be regarded as a modern substitute
for the earlier Rhone demon. We probably get closer to the original
form of the superstition in the Swiss Oberland, which interprets the
noises of the Furka Glacier, which feeds the Rhone, as the groans of
wicked souls condemned for ever to labour there in directing the
river&rsquo;s course; their mistress being a demoness who sometimes
appears just before the floods, floating on a raft, and ordering the
river to rise. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb118" href="#v1pb118"
name="v1pb118">118</a>]</span></p>
<p>There is a tidal demonolatry also. The author of &lsquo;Rambles in
Northumberland&rsquo; gives a tradition concerning the river Wansbeck:
&lsquo;This river discharges itself into the sea at a place called
Cambois, about nine miles to the eastward, and the tide flows to within
five miles of Morpeth. Tradition reports that Michael Scott, whose fame
as a wizard is not confined to Scotland, would have brought the tide to
the town had not the courage of the person failed upon whom the
execution of this project depended. This agent of Michael, after his
principal had performed certain spells, was to run from the
neighbourhood of Cambois to Morpeth without looking behind, and the
tide would follow him. After having advanced a certain distance he
became alarmed at the roaring of the waters behind him, and forgetting
the injunction, gave a glance over his shoulder to see if the danger
was imminent, when the advancing tide immediately stopped, and the
burgesses of Morpeth thus lost the chance of having the Wansbeck
navigable between their town and the sea. It is also said that Michael
intended to confer a similar favour on the inhabitants of Durham, by
making the Wear navigable to their city; but his good intentions, which
were to be carried into effect in the same manner, were also frustrated
by the cowardice of the person who had to guide the tide.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The gentle and just king &AElig;olus, who taught his islanders
navigation, in his mythologic transfiguration had to share the wayward
dispositions of the winds he was said to rule; but though he wrecked
the Trojan fleet and many a ship, his old human heart remained to be
trusted on the appearance of Halcyon. His unhappy daughter of that name
cast herself into the sea after the shipwreck of her husband
(Ce&#775;yx), and the two were changed into birds. It was believed that
for seven days before and seven after <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb119" href="#v1pb119" name="v1pb119">119</a>]</span>the shortest
day of the year, when the halcyon is breeding, &AElig;olus restrains
his winds, and the sea is calm. The accent of this fable has been
transmitted to some variants of the folklore of swans. In Russia the
Tsar Morskoi or Water Demon&rsquo;s beautiful daughters (swans) may
naturally be supposed to influence the tides which the fair bathers of
our time are reduced to obey. In various regions the tides are believed
to have some relation to swans, and to respect them. I have met with a
notion of this kind in England. On the day of Livingstone&rsquo;s
funeral there was an extraordinary tide in the Thames, which had been
predicted and provided for. The crowds which had gathered at the Abbey
on that occasion repaired after the funeral to Westminster Bridge to
observe the tide, and among them was a venerable disbeliever in
science, who announced to a group that there would be no high tide,
&lsquo;because the swans were nesting.&rsquo; This sceptic was speedily
put to confusion by the result, and perhaps one superstition the less
remained in the circle that seemed to regard him as an oracle.</p>
<p>The Russian peasantry live in much fear of the Rusalkas and
Vodyanuie, water-spirits who, of course, have for their chief the surly
Neptune Tsar Morskoi. In deprecation of this tribe, the peasant is
careful not to bathe without a cross round the neck, nor to ford a
stream on horseback without signing a cross on the water with a scythe
or knife. In the Ukrain these water-demons are supposed to be the
transformed souls of Pharaoh and his host when they were drowned, and
they are increased by people who drown themselves. In Bohemia fishermen
are known sometimes to refuse aid to one drowning, for fear the Vodyany
will be offended and prevent the fish, over which he holds rule, from
entering their nets. The wrath of such beings is indicated by the
upheavals of water and foam; and they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb120" href="#v1pb120" name="v1pb120">120</a>]</span>are supposed
especially mischievous in the spring, when torrents and floods are
pouring from melted snow. Those undefined monsters which Beowulf slew,
Grendel and his mother, are interpreted by Simrock as personifications
of the untamed sea and stormy floods invading the low flat shores,
whose devastations so filled Faust with horror (II. iv.), and in
combating which his own hitherto desolating powers found their
task.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The Sea sweeps on in thousand quarters flowing,</p>
<p class="line">Itself unfruitful, barrenness bestowing;</p>
<p class="line">It breaks, and swells, and rolls, and overwhelms</p>

<p class="line">Let that high joy be mine for evermore,</p>
<p class="line">To shut the lordly Ocean from the shore,</p>
<p class="line">The watery waste to limit and to bar,</p>
<p class="line">And push it back upon itself afar!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In such brave work Faust had many forerunners, whose
art and courage have their monument in the fairer fables of all these
elemental powers in which fear saw demons. Pavana, in India, messenger
of the gods, rides upon the winds, and in his forty-nine forms,
corresponding with the points of the Hindu compass, guards the earth.
Solomon, too, journeyed on a magic carpet woven of the winds, which
still serves the purposes of the Wise. From the churned ocean rose
Lakshm&iacute; (after the solar origin was lost to the myth), Hindu
goddess of prosperity; and from the sea-foam rose Aphrodite, Beauty.
These fair forms had their true worshipper in the Northman, who left on
mastered wind and wave his song as Emerson found it&mdash;</p>

&lsquo;Folklore of China,&rsquo; p. 124. The drum held by the imp in
<a href="#v1fig3">Fig. 3</a> shows his relation to the thunder-god. In
Japan the thunder-god is represented as having five drums strung
together. The wind-god has a large bag of compressed air between his
shoulders; and he has steel claws, representing the keen and piercing
wind. The Tartars in Siberia believe that a potent demon may be evoked
by beating a drum; their sorcerers provide a tame bear, who starts upon
the scene, and from whom they pretend to get answers to questions. In
Nova Scotian superstition we find demons charmed by drums into
quietude. In India the temple-drum preserved such solemn associations
even for the new theistic sect, the Brahmo-Somaj, that it is said to be
still beaten as accompaniment to the organ sent to their chief church
by their English friends.</p>

Although the Koran and other authorities, as already stated, have
associated the Jinn with etherial fire, Arabic folklore is nearer the
meaning of the word in assigning the name to all demons. The learned
Arabic lexicographer of Beirut, P. Bustani, says &lsquo;The Jinn is the
opposite of mankind, or it is whatever is veiled from the sense,
whether angel or devil.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="first">The animal demons&mdash;those whose evil repute is the
result of something in their nature which may be inimical to
man&mdash;should be distinguished from the forms which have been
diabolised by association with mythological personages or ideas. The
lion, tiger, and wolf are examples of the one class; the stag, horse,
owl, and raven of the other. But there are circumstances which render
it very difficult to observe this distinction. The line has to be
drawn, if at all, between the measureless forces of degradation on the
one side, discovering some evil in animals which, but for their bad
associations, would not have been much thought of; and of euphemism on
the other, transforming harmful beasts to benignant agents by dwelling
upon some minor characteristic.</p>
<p>There are a few obviously dangerous animals, such as the serpent,
where it is easy to pick our way; we can recognise the fear that
flatters it to an agathodemon and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb122" href="#v1pb122" name="v1pb122">122</a>]</span>the diminished
fear that pronounces it accurst.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3338src"
href="#xd20e3338" name="xd20e3338src">1</a> But what shall be said of
the Goat? Was there really anything in its smell or in its flesh when
first eaten, its butting, or injury to plants, which originally classed
it among the unclean animals? or was it merely demonised because of its
uncanny and shaggy appearance? What explanation can be given of the
evil repute of our household friend the Cat? Is it derived by
inheritance from its fierce ancestors of the jungle? Was it first
suggested by its horrible human-like sleep-murdering caterwaulings at
night? or has it simply suffered from a theological curse on the cats
said to draw the chariots of the goddesses of Beauty? The demonic Dog
is, if anything, a still more complex subject. The student of mythology
and folklore speedily becomes familiar with the trivial sources from
which vast streams of superstition often issue. The cock&rsquo;s
challenge to the all-detecting sun no doubt originated his ominous
career from the Code of Manu to the cock-headed devils frescoed in the
cathedrals of Russia. The fleshy, forked roots of a soporific plant
issued in that vast Mandrake Mythology which has been the subject of
many volumes, without being even yet fully explored. The Italians have
a saying that &lsquo;One knavery of the hedgehog is worth more than
many of the fox;&rsquo; yet the nocturnal and hibernating habits and
general quaintness of the humble hedgehog, rather than his furtive
propensity to prey on eggs and chickens, must have raised him to the
honours of demonhood. In various popular fables this little animal
proves more than a match for the wolf and the serpent. It was in the
form of a hedgehog that the Devil is said to have made the attempt to
let in the sea through the Brighton Downs, which was prevented by a
light being <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb123" href="#v1pb123"
name="v1pb123">123</a>]</span>brought, though the seriousness of the
scheme is still attested in the Devil&rsquo;s Dyke. There is an ancient
tradition that when the Devil had smuggled himself into Noah&rsquo;s
Ark, he tried to sink it by boring a hole; but this scheme was
defeated, and the human race saved, by the hedgehog stuffing himself
into the hole. In the Brighton story the Devil would appear to have
remembered his former failure in drowning people, and to have
appropriated the form which defeated him.</p>

</div>
<p>The Fox, as incarnation of cunning, holds in the primitive belief of
the Japanese almost the same position as the Serpent in the nations
that have worshipped, until bold enough to curse it. In many of the
early pictures of Japanese demons one may generally detect amid their
human, wolfish, or other characters some traits of the <i>kitsune</i>
(fox). He is always the soul of the three-eyed demon of Japan (<a href=
"#v1fig7">fig. 7</a>). He is the sagacious &lsquo;Vizier,&rsquo; as the
Persian Desatir calls him, and is practically the Japanese scape-goat.
If a fox has appeared in any neighbourhood, the next trouble is
attributed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb124" href="#v1pb124" name=
"v1pb124">124</a>]</span>to his visit; and on such occasions the
sufferers and their friends repair to some ancient gnarled tree in
which the fox is theoretically resident and propitiate him, just as
would be done to a serpent in other regions. In Japan the fox is not
regarded as always harmful, but generally so. He is not to be killed on
any account. Being thus spared through superstition, the foxes increase
sufficiently to supply abundant material for the continuance of its
demonic character. &lsquo;Take us the foxes, the little foxes that
spoil the vines,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3360src" href=
"#xd20e3360" name="xd20e3360src">2</a> is an admonition reversed in
Japan. The correspondence between the cunning respected in this animal
and that of the serpent, reverenced elsewhere, is confirmed by Mr. Fitz
Cunliffe Owen, who observed, as he informs me, that the Japanese will
not kill even the poisonous snakes which crawl freely amid the decaying
Buddhist temples of Nikko, one of the most sacred places in Japan,
where once as many as eight thousand monastic Buddhists were harboured.
It is the red fox that abounds in Japan, and its human-like cry at
night near human habitations is such as might easily encourage these
superstitions. But, furthermore, mythology supplies many illustrations
of a creditable tendency among rude tribes to mark out for special
veneration or fear any force in nature finer than mere strength.
Emerson says, &lsquo;Foxes are so cunning because they are not
strong.&rsquo; In our Japanese demon, whose three eyes alone connect it
with the pr&aelig;ternatural vision ascribed by that race to the fox,
the harelip is very pronounced. That little animal, the Hare, is
associated with a large mythology, perhaps because out of its weakness
proceeds its main forces of survival&mdash;timidity, vigilance, and
swiftness. The superstition concerning the hare is found in Africa. The
same animal is the much-venerated good genius of the Calmucs, who call
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb125" href="#v1pb125" name=
"v1pb125">125</a>]</span>him S&aacute;kya-muni (Buddha), and say that
on earth he submitted himself to be eaten by a starving man, for which
gracious deed he was raised to dominion over the moon, where they
profess to see him. The legend is probably traceable back to the
Sanskrit word <i>sasin</i>, moon, which means literally &lsquo;the
hare-marked.&rsquo; <i>Sasa</i> means &lsquo;hare.&rsquo; Pausanias
relates the story of the moon-goddess instructing exiles to build their
city where they shall see a hare take refuge in a
myrtle-grove.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3374src" href="#xd20e3374"
name="xd20e3374src">3</a> In the demonic fauna of Japan another cunning
animal figures&mdash;the Weasel. The name of this demon is &lsquo;the
sickle weasel,&rsquo; and it also seems to occupy the position of a
scape-goat. In the language of a Japanese report, &lsquo;When a
person&rsquo;s clogs slip from under his feet, and he falls and cuts
his face on the gravel, or when a person, who is out at night when he
ought to have been at home, presents himself to his family with a
freshly-scarred face, the wound is referred to the agency of the
malignant invisible weasel and his sharp sickle.&rsquo; In an
aboriginal legend of America, also, two sister demons commonly take the
form of weasels.</p>
<p>The popular feeling which underlay much of the animal-worship in
ancient times was probably that which is reflected in the Japanese
notions of to-day, as told in the subjoined sketch from an amusing
book.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One of these visitors was an old man, who himself was at the
time a victim of a popular superstition that the departed revisit the
scenes of their life in this world in shapes of different animals. We
noticed that he was not in his usual spirits, and pressed him to
unburden his mind to us. He said he had lost his little son Chiosin,
but that was not so much the cause of his grief as the absurd way in
which his wife, backed up by a whole conclave of old women who had
taken up their abode in his house to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb126" href="#v1pb126" name="v1pb126">126</a>]</span>comfort her,
was going on. &lsquo;What do they all do?&rsquo; we asked
sympathetically. &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;every beastly
animal that comes to my house, there is a cry amongst them all,
&lsquo;Chiosin, Chiosin has come back!&rsquo; and the whole house
swarms with cats and dogs and bats&mdash;for they say they are not
quite sure which is Chiosin, and that they had better be kind to the
lot than run the chance of treating him badly; the consequence is, all
these brutes are fed on my rice and meat, and now I am driven out of
doors and called an unnatural parent because I killed a mosquito which
bit me!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3383src" href="#xd20e3383"
name="xd20e3383src">4</a></p>
<p>The strange and inexplicable behaviour of animals in cases of fear,
panic, or pain has been generally attributed by ignorant races to their
possession by demons. Of this nature is the story of the devil entering
the herd of swine and carrying them into the sea, related in the New
Testament. It is said that even yet in some parts of Scotland the
milkmaid carries a switch of the magical rowan to expel the demon that
sometimes enters the cow. Professor Monier Williams writes from
Southern India&mdash;&lsquo;When my fellow-travellers and myself were
nearly dashed to pieces over a precipice the other day by some restive
horses on a ghat near Poona, we were told that the road at this
particular point was haunted by devils who often caused similar
accidents, and we were given to understand that we should have done
well to conciliate Ganesa, son of the god Siva, and all his troops of
evil spirits, before starting.&rsquo; The same writer also tells us
that the guardian spirits or &lsquo;mothers&rsquo; who haunt most
regions of the Peninsula are believed to ride about on horses, and if
they are angry, scatter blight and disease. Hence the traveller just
arrived from Europe is startled <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb127"
href="#v1pb127" name="v1pb127">127</a>]</span>and puzzled by
apparitions of rudely-formed terra-cotta horses, often as large as
life, placed by the peasantry round shrines in the middle of fields as
acceptable propitiatory offerings, or in the fulfilment of vows in
periods of sickness.<a id="xd20e3390" name="xd20e3390"></a><a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e3391src" href="#xd20e3391" name=
"xd20e3391src">5</a></p>
<p>This was the belief of the Corinthians in the Taraxippos, or shade
of Glaucus, who, having been torn in pieces by the horses with which he
had been racing, and which he had fed on human flesh to make more
spirited, remained to haunt the Isthmus and frighten horses during the
races.</p>
<p>There is a modern legend in the Far West (America) of a horse called
&lsquo;The White Devil,&rsquo; which, in revenge for some harm to its
comrades, slew men by biting and trampling them, and was itself slain
after defying many attempts at its capture; but among the many ancient
legends of demon-horses there are few which suggest anything about that
animal hostile to man. His occasional evil character is simply derived
from his association with man, and is therefore postponed. For a
similar reason the Goat also must be dealt with hereafter, and as a
symbolical animal. A few myths are met with which relate to its
unpleasant characteristics. In South Guinea the odour of goats is
accounted for by the Saga that their ancestor having had the
presumption to ask a goddess for her aromatic ointment, she angrily
rubbed him with ointment of a reverse kind. It has also been said that
it was regarded as a demon by the worshippers of Bacchus, because it
cropped the vines; and that it thus originated the Trageluphoi, or
goat-stag monsters mentioned by Plato,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e3399src" href="#xd20e3399" name="xd20e3399src">6</a> and gave us
also the word <i>tragedy</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3405src" href=
"#xd20e3405" name="xd20e3405src">7</a> But such traits of the Goat can
have very little to do with its important relations to Mythology
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb128" href="#v1pb128" name=
"v1pb128">128</a>]</span>and Demonology. To the list of animals
demonised by association must also be added the Stag. No doubt the
anxious mothers, wives, or sweethearts of rash young huntsmen utilised
the old fables of beautiful hinds which in the deep forests changed to
demons and devoured their pursuers,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3410src"
href="#xd20e3410" name="xd20e3410src">8</a> for admonition; but the
fact that such stags had to transform themselves for evil work is a
sufficient certificate of character to prevent their being included
among the animal demons proper, that is, such as have in whole or part
supplied in their disposition to harm man the basis of a demonic
representation.</p>
<p>It will not be deemed wonderful that Rats bear a venerable rank in
Demonology. The shudder which some nervous persons feel at sight of
even a harmless mouse is a survival from the time when it was believed
that in this form unshriven souls or unbaptized children haunted their
former homes; and probably it would be difficult to estimate the number
of ghost-stories which have originated in their nocturnal scamperings.
Many legends report the departure of unhallowed souls from human mouths
in the shape of a Mouse. During the earlier Napoleonic wars mice were
used in Southern Germany as diviners, by being set with inked feet on
the map of Europe to show where the fatal Frenchmen would march. They
gained this sanctity by a series of associations with force stretching
back to the Hindu fable of a mouse delivering the elephant and the lion
by gnawing the cords that bound them. The battle of the Frogs and Mice
is ascribed to Homer. Mice are said to have foretold the first civil
war in Rome by gnawing the gold in the temple. Rats appear in various
legends as avengers. The uncles of King Popelus II., murdered by him
and his wife and thrown into a lake, reappear as rats and gnaw the king
and queen to death. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb129" href=
"#v1pb129" name="v1pb129">129</a>]</span>The same fate overtakes
Miskilaus of Poland, through the transformed widows and orphans he had
wronged. Mouse Tower, standing in the middle of the Rhine, is the
haunted monument of cruel Archbishop Hatto, of Mainz, who (anno 970)
bade the famine-stricken people repair to his barn, wherein he shut
them fast and burned them. But next morning an army of rats, having
eaten all the corn in his granaries, darkened the roads to the palace.
The prelate sought refuge from them in the Tower, but they swam after,
gnawed through the walls and devoured him.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>St. Gertrude, wearing the funereal mantle of Holda, commands an army
of mice. In this respect she succeeds to the Pied Piper of Hamelin, who
also leads off children; and my ingenious friend Mr. John Fiske
suggests that this may be the reason why Irish servant-maids often show
such frantic terror at sight of a mouse.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e3424src" href="#xd20e3424" name="xd20e3424src">10</a> The care of
children is often intrusted to them, and the appearance of mice
prognosticated of old the appearance of the pr&aelig;ternatural
rat-catcher and psychopomp. Pliny says that in his time it was
considered fortunate to meet a white rat. The people of Bassorah always
bow to these revered animals when seen, no doubt to propitiate
them.</p>
<p>The Lion is a symbol of majesty and of the sun in his glory (reached
in the zodiacal Leo), though here and there his original demonic
character appears,&mdash;as in the combats of Indra, Samson, and
Herakles with terrible lions. Euphemism, in one sense, fulfils the
conditions of Samson&rsquo;s riddle&mdash;Sweetness coming out of the
Strong&mdash;and has brought honey out of the Lion. His cruel character
has subtly fallen to Sirius the Dog-star, to whom are ascribed the
drought and malaria of &lsquo;dog-days&rsquo; (when the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb130" href="#v1pb130" name=
"v1pb130">130</a>]</span>sun is in Leo); but the primitive fact is
intimated in several fables like that of Arist&aelig;us, who, born
after his mother had been rescued from the Lybian lion, was worshipped
in Ceos as a saviour from both droughts and lions. The Lion couching at
the feet of beautiful Doorga in India, reappears drawing the chariot of
Aphrodite, and typifies the potency of beauty rather than, as Emerson
interprets, that beauty depends on strength. The chariot of the Norse
Venus, Freyja, was drawn by Cats, diminished forms of her Southern
sister&rsquo;s steeds. It was partly by these routes the Cat came to
play the sometimes beneficent r&ocirc;le in Russian, and to some extent
in German, French, and English folklore,&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Puss in
Boots, Whittington and his Cat, and Madame D&rsquo;Aulnoy&rsquo;s <i>La
Chatte Blanche</i>. The demonic characteristics of the destructive cats
have been inherited by the black,&mdash;or, as in Macbeth, the
brindled,&mdash;cat. In Germany the approach of a cat to a sick-bed
announces death; to dream of one is an evil omen. In Hungary it is said
every black cat becomes a witch at the age of seven. It is the
witch&rsquo;s favourite riding-horse, but may sometimes be saved from
such servitude by incision of the sign of the cross. A scratch from a
black cat is thought to be the beginning of a fatal spell.</p>
<p>De Gubernatis<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3439src" href="#xd20e3439"
name="xd20e3439src">11</a> has a very curious speculation concerning
the origin of our familiar fable the Kilkenny Cats, which he traces to
the German superstition which dreads the combat between cats as
presaging death to one who witnesses it; and this belief he finds
reflected in the Tuscan child&rsquo;s &lsquo;game of souls,&rsquo; in
which the devil and angel are supposed to contend for the soul. The
author thinks this may be one outcome of the contest between Night and
Twilight in Mythology; but, if the connection can be traced, it would
probably prove to be derived <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb131"
href="#v1pb131" name="v1pb131">131</a>]</span>from the struggle between
the two angels of Death, one variation of which is associated with the
legend of the strife for the body of Moses. The Book of Enoch says that
Gabriel was sent, before the Flood, to excite the man-devouring giants
to destroy one another. In an ancient Persian picture in my possession,
animal monsters are shown devouring each other, while their proffered
victim, like Daniel, is unharmed. The idea is a natural one, and hardly
requires comparative tracing.</p>
<p>Dr. Dennys tells us that in China there exists precisely the same
superstition as in Scotland as to the evil omen of a cat (or dog)
passing over a corpse. Brand and Pennant both mention this, the latter
stating that the cat or dog that has so done is killed without mercy.
This fact would seem to show that the fear is for the living, lest the
soul of the deceased should enter the animal and become one of the
innumerable werewolf or vampyre class of demons. But the origin of the
superstition is no doubt told in the Slavonic belief that if a cat leap
over a corpse the deceased person will become a vampyre.</p>
<p>In Russia the cat enjoys a somewhat better reputation than it does
in most other countries. Several peasants in the neighbourhood of
Moscow assured me that while they would never be willing to remain in a
church where a dog had entered, they would esteem it a good sign if a
cat came to church. One aged woman near Moscow told me that when the
Devil once tried to creep into Paradise he took the form of a mouse:
the Dog and Cat were on guard at the gates, and the Dog allowed the
evil one to pass, but the Cat pounced on him, and so defeated another
treacherous attempt against human felicity.</p>
<p>The Cat superstition has always been strong in Great Britain. It is,
indeed, in one sense true, as old Howell wrote (1647)&mdash;&lsquo;We
need not cross the sea for examples <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb132" href="#v1pb132" name="v1pb132">132</a>]</span>of this kind,
we have too many (God wot) at home: King James a great while was loath
to believe there were witches; but that which happened to my Lord
Francis of Rutland&rsquo;s children convinced him, who were bewitched
by an old woman that was a servant of Belvoir Castle, but, being
displeased, she contracted with the Devil, who conversed with her in
the form of a Cat, whom she called Rutterkin, to make away those
children out of mere malignity and thirst of revenge.&rsquo; It is to
be feared that many a poor woman has been burned as a witch against
whom her cherished cat was the chief witness. It would be a curious
psychological study to trace how far the superstition owns a survival
in even scientific minds,&mdash;as in Buffon&rsquo;s vituperation of
the cat, and in the astonishing story, told by Mr. Wood, of a cat which
saw a ghost (anno 1877)!</p>
<p>The Dog, so long the faithful friend of man, and even, possibly,
because of the degree to which he has caught his master&rsquo;s
manners, has a large demonic history. In the Semitic stories there are
many that indicate the path by which &lsquo;dog&rsquo; became the
Mussulman synonym of infidel; and the one dog Katmir who in Arabic
legend was admitted to Paradise for his faithful watching three hundred
and nine years before the cave of the Seven Sleepers,<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e3454src" href="#xd20e3454" name="xd20e3454src">12</a> must
have drifted among the Moslems from India as the Ephesian Sleepers did
from the christian world. In the beautiful episode of the
&lsquo;Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata,&rsquo; Yudhisthira having journeyed
to the door of heaven, refuses to enter into that happy abode unless
his faithful dog is admitted also. He is told by Indra, &lsquo;My
heaven hath no place for dogs; they steal away our offerings on
earth;&rsquo; and again, &lsquo;If a dog but behold a sacrifice, men
esteem it unholy and void.&rsquo; This difficulty was solved
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb133" href="#v1pb133" name=
"v1pb133">133</a>]</span>by the Dog&mdash;Yama in
disguise&mdash;revealing himself and praising his friend&rsquo;s
fidelity. It is tolerably clear that it is to his connection with Yama,
god of Death, and under the evolution of that dualism which divided the
universe into upper and nether, that the Dog was degraded among our
Aryan ancestors; at the same time his sometimes wolfish disposition and
some other natural characters supplied the basis of his demonic
character. He was at once a dangerous and a corruptible guard.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Fig. 8.&mdash;<span class="sc">Cerberus</span>
(Calmet).</p>
</div>
<p>In the early Vedic Mythology it is the abode of the gods that is
guarded by the two dogs, identified by solar mythologists as the
morning and evening twilight: a later phase shows them in the service
of Yama, and they reappear in the guardian of the Greek Hades,
Cerberus, and Orthros. The first of these has been traced to the Vedic
Sarvara, the latter to the monster Vritra. &lsquo;Orthros&rsquo; is the
phonetical equivalent of Vritra. The bitch Sarama, mother of the two
Vedic dogs, proved a treacherous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb134"
href="#v1pb134" name="v1pb134">134</a>]</span>guard, and was slain by
Indra. Hence the Russian peasant comes fairly by another version of how
the Dog, while on guard, admitted the Devil into heaven on being thrown
a bone. But the two watch-dogs of the Hindu myth do not seem to bear an
evil character. In a funeral hymn of the &lsquo;Rig-Veda&rsquo; (x.
14), addressed to Yama, King of Death, we read:&mdash;&lsquo;By an
auspicious path do thou hasten past the two four-eyed brindled dogs,
the offspring of Sarama; then approach the beautiful Pitris who rejoice
together with Yama. Intrust him, O Yama, to thy two watch-dogs,
four-eyed, road-guarding, and man-observing. The two brown messengers
of Yama, broad of nostril and insatiable, wander about among men; may
they give us again to-day the auspicious breath of life that we may see
the sun!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And now thousands of years after this was said we find the Dog still
regarded as the seer of ghosts, and watcher at the gates of death, of
whose opening his howl forewarns. The howling of a dog on the night of
December 9, 1871, at Sandringham, where the Prince of Wales lay ill,
was thought important enough for newspapers to report to a shuddering
country. I read lately of a dog in a German village which was supposed
to have announced so many deaths that he became an object of general
terror, and was put to death. In that country belief in the demonic
character of the dog seems to have been strong enough to transmit an
influence even to the powerful brain of Goethe.</p>
<p>In Goethe&rsquo;s poem, it was when Faust was walking with the
student Wagner that the black Dog appeared, rushing around them in
spiral curves&mdash;spreading, as Faust said, &lsquo;a magic coil as a
snare around them;&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3476src" href=
"#xd20e3476" name="xd20e3476src">13</a> that after this dog
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb135" href="#v1pb135" name=
"v1pb135">135</a>]</span>had followed Faust into his study, it assumed
a monstrous shape, until changed to a mist, from which Mephistopheles
steps forth&mdash;&lsquo;the kernel of the brute&rsquo;&mdash;in guise
of a travelling scholar. This is in notable coincidence with the
archaic symbolism of the Dog as the most frequent form of the
&lsquo;Lares&rsquo; (<a href="#v1fig9">fig. 9</a>), or household genii,
originally because of its vigilance. The form here presented is nearly
identical with the Cynocephalus, whom the learned author of
&lsquo;Mankind: their Origin and Destiny,&rsquo; identifies as the
Adamic being set as a watch and instructor in Eden (Gen. xvi. 15), an
example of which, holding pen and tablet (as described by Horapollo),
is given in that work from Phil&aelig;. Chrysippus says that these were
afterwards represented as young men clothed with dog-skins. Remnants of
the tutelary character of the dog are scattered through German
folklore: he is regarded as oracle, ghost-seer, and gifted with second
sight; in Bohemia he is sometimes made to lick an infant&rsquo;s face
that it may see well.</p>

</div>
<p>The passage in &lsquo;Faust&rsquo; has been traced to Goethe&rsquo;s
antipathy to dogs, as expressed in his conversation with Falk at the
time of Wieland&rsquo;s death. &lsquo;Annihilation is utterly out of
the question; but the possibility of being caught on the way by some
more powerful and yet baser monas, and subordinated to it; this is
unquestionably a very serious consideration; and I, for my part, have
never been able entirely to divest myself of the fear of it, in the way
of a mere observation of nature.&rsquo; At this moment, says Falk, a
dog was heard repeatedly barking in the street. Goethe, sprang hastily
to the window and called to it: &lsquo;Take what <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb136" href="#v1pb136" name=
"v1pb136">136</a>]</span>form you will, vile larva, you shall not
subjugate me!<span class="corr" id="xd20e3506" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span> After some pause, he resumed with the
remark: &lsquo;This rabble of creation is extremely offensive. It is a
perfect pack of monades with which we are thrown together in this
planetary nook; their company will do us little honour with the
inhabitants of other planets, if they happen to hear anything about
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In visiting the house where Goethe once resided in Weimar, I was
startled to find as the chief ornament of the hall a large bronze dog,
of full size, and very dark, looking proudly forth, as if he possessed
the Goethean monas after all. However, it is not probable that the
poet&rsquo;s real dislike of dogs arose solely from that speculation
about monades. It is more probable that in observing the old
wall-picture in Auerbach&rsquo;s cellar, wherein a dog stands beside
Mephistopheles, Goethe was led to consider carefully the causes of that
intimacy. Unfortunately, and notwithstanding the fables and the
sentiment which invest that animal, there are some very repulsive
things about him, such as his tendency to madness and the infliction on
man of a frightful death. The Greek Mania&rsquo;s &lsquo;fleet
hounds&rsquo; (Bacch&aelig; 977) have spread terrors far and wide.</p>
<p>Those who carefully peruse the account given by Mr. Lewes of the
quarrel between Karl August and Goethe, on account of the opposition of
the latter to the introduction of a performing dog on the Weimar
stage&mdash;an incident which led to his resignation of his position of
intendant of the theatre&mdash;may detect this aversion mingling with
his disgust as an artist; and it may be also suspected that it was not
the mere noise which caused the tortures he described himself as having
once endured at G&ouml;ttingen from the barking of dogs.</p>
<p>It is, however, not improbable that in the wild notion of Goethe,
joined with his cynophobia, we find a survival of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb137" href="#v1pb137" name=
"v1pb137">137</a>]</span>the belief of the Parsees of Surat, who
venerate the Dog above all other animals, and who, when one is dying,
place a dog&rsquo;s muzzle near his mouth, and make it bark twice, so
that it may catch the departing soul, and bear it to the waiting
angel.</p>
<p>The devil-worshippers of Travancore to this day declare that the
evil power approaches them in the form of a Dog, as Mephistopheles
approached Faust. But before the superstition reached Goethe&rsquo;s
poem it had undergone many modifications; and especially its keen scent
had influenced the Norse imagination to ascribe to it
pr&aelig;ternatural wisdom. Thus we read in the Saga of Hakon the Good,
that when Eystein the Bad had conquered Drontheim, he offered the
people choice of his slave Thorer or his dog Sauer to be their king.
They chose the Dog. &lsquo;Now the dog was by witchcraft gifted with
three men&rsquo;s wisdom; and when he barked he spoke one word and
barked two.&rsquo; This Dog wore a collar of gold, and sat on a throne,
but, for all his wisdom and power, seems to have been a dog still; for
when some wolves invaded the cattle, he attacked and was torn to pieces
by them.</p>
<p>Among the negroes of the Southern States in America I have found the
belief that the most frequent form of a diabolical apparition is that
of a large Dog with fiery eyes, which may be among them an original
superstition attributable to their horror of the bloodhound, by which,
in some regions, they were pursued when attempting to escape. Among the
whites of the same region I have never been able to find any instance
of the same belief, though belief in the presage of the howling dog is
frequent; and it is possible that this is a survival from some region
in Africa, where the Dog has an evil name of the same kind as the
scape-goat. Among some tribes in Fazogl there is an annual carnival at
which every one does as he likes. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb138" href="#v1pb138" name="v1pb138">138</a>]</span>king is then
seated in the open air, a dog tied to the leg of his chair, and the
animal is then stoned to death.</p>
<p>Mark Twain<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3525src" href="#xd20e3525"
name="xd20e3525src">14</a> records the folklore of a village of
Missouri, where we find lads quaking with fear at the howling of a
&lsquo;stray dog&rsquo; in the night, but indifferent to the howling of
a dog they recognise, which may be a form of the common English belief
that it is unlucky to be followed by a &lsquo;strange&rsquo; dog. From
the same book it appears also that the dog will always have his head in
the direction of the person whose doom is signified: the lads are
entirely relieved when they find the howling animal has his back turned
to them.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that these fragments of European superstition
should meet in the Far West a plentiful crop of their like which has
sprung up among the aborigines, as the following extract from Mr.
Brinton&rsquo;s work, &lsquo;Myths of the New World,&rsquo; will show:
&lsquo;Dogs were supposed to stand in some peculiar relation to the
moon, probably because they howl at it and run at night, uncanny
practices which have cost them dear in reputation. The custom prevailed
among tribes so widely asunder as Peruvians, Tupis, Creeks, Iroquois,
Algonquins, and Greenland Eskimos to thrash the curs most soundly
during an eclipse. The Creeks explained this by saying that the big Dog
was swallowing the sun, and that by whipping the little ones they could
make him desist. What the big Dog was they were not prepared to say. We
know. It was the night goddess, represented by the Dog, who was thus
shrouding the world at mid-day. In a better sense, they represented the
more agreeable characteristics of the lunar goddess. Xochiquetzal, most
fecund of Aztec divinities, patroness of love, of sexual pleasure, and
of child-birth, was likewise called <i>Itzcuinan</i>, which, literally
translated, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb139" href="#v1pb139"
name="v1pb139">139</a>]</span>is &lsquo;bitch-mother.&rsquo; This
strange and to us so repugnant title for a goddess was not without
parallel elsewhere. When in his wars the Inca Pachacutec carried his
arms into the province of Huanca, he found its inhabitants had
installed in their temples the figure of a Dog as their highest
deity.... This canine canonisation explains why in some parts of Peru a
priest was called, by way of honour, <i>allco</i>, Dog!... Many tribes
on the Pacific coast united in the adoration of a wild species, the
coyote, the <i lang="la">Canis latrans</i> of naturalists.&rsquo; Of
the Dog-demon Chantico the legend of the Nahuas was, &lsquo;that he
made a sacrifice to the gods without observing a preparatory fast, for
which he was punished by being changed into a Dog. He then invoked the
god of death to deliver him, which attempt to evade a just punishment
so enraged the divinities that they immersed the world in
water.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The common phrase &lsquo;hell-hounds&rsquo; has come to us by
various routes. Diana being degraded to Hecate, the dogs of Hades,
Orthros and Cerberus, multiplied into a pack of hounds for her chase,
were degraded with her into infernal howlers and hunters. A like
degradation of Odin&rsquo;s hunt took place at a later date. The Wild
Huntsman, being a diabolical character, is considered elsewhere.
Concerning the Dog, it may be further said here, that there are
probably various characteristics of that animal reflected in his
demonic character. His liability to become rabid, and to afflict human
beings with hydrophobia, appears to have had some part in it. Spinoza
alludes to the custom in his time of destroying persons suffering from
this canine rabies by suffocation; and his English biographer and
editor, Dr. Willis, tells me that in his boyhood in Scotland he always
heard this spoken of as the old custom. That such treatment could have
prevailed can hardly be ascribed to anything but a belief in the
demonic character of the rabid <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb140"
href="#v1pb140" name="v1pb140">140</a>]</span>dog, cognate with the
unconscious superstition which still causes rural magistrates to order
a dog which has bitten any one to be slain. The notion is, that if the
dog goes mad thereafter, the man will also. Of course it would be
rational to preserve the dog&rsquo;s life carefully, in order that, if
it continues healthy, the bitten may feel reassured, as he cannot be if
it be dead.</p>
<p>But the degradation of the dog had a cause even in his fidelity as a
watch. For this, as we have just seen, made him a common form among
Lares or domestic demons. The teraphim also were often in this shape.
Christianity had therefore a special reason for ascribing an infernal
character to these little idols, which interfered with the popular
dependence on the saints. It will thus be seen that there were many
causes operating to create that formidable class of demons which were
called in the Middle Ages Cynocephaloi. The ancient holy pictures of
Russia especially abound in these dog-headed devils; in the sixteenth
century they were frequently represented rending souls in hell; and
sometimes the dragon of the Apocalypse is represented with seven
horrible canine heads.</p>
<p>M. Toussenel, in his transcendental interpretations, has identified
the Wolf as the bandit and outlaw.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3550src"
href="#xd20e3550" name="xd20e3550src">15</a> The proverbial
medi&aelig;val phrase for an outlaw&mdash;one who wears a <i lang=
"xx">teste l&oelig;ve, caput lupinum, wulfesheofod</i>, which the
ingenious author perhaps remembered&mdash;is of good antiquity. The
wolf is called robber in the &lsquo;Rig-Veda,&rsquo; and he is there
also demonised, since we find him fleeing before a devotee. (In the
Zend &lsquo;Vendidad&rsquo; the souls of the pious fear to meet the
wolf on the way to heaven.) The god Pushan is invoked against the evil
wolf, the malignant spirit.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3556src" href=

"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb141" href="#v1pb141" name=
"v1pb141">141</a>]</span>that to dream of a wolf announces a robber.
There is in the wolf, at the same time, that always attractive love of
liberty which, in the well-known fable, makes him prefer leanness to
the comfort of the collar-wearing dog, which makes him among demonic
animals sometimes the same as the mighty huntsmen Nimrod and shaggy
Esau among humanised demons. One is not surprised to find occasionally
good stories about the wolf. Thus the Nez Perces tribe in America trace
the origin of the human race to a wolf. They say that originally, when
there were nothing but animals, there was a huge monster which devoured
them whole and alive. This monster swallowed a wolf, who, when he
entered its belly, found the animals therein snarling at and biting one
another as they had done on the earth outside. The wolf exhorted them
that their common sufferings should teach them friendliness, and
finally he induced them to a system of co-operation by which they made
their way out through the side of the monster, which instantly
perished. The animals so released were at once transformed to men, how
and why the advocates of co-operation will readily understand, and
founded the Nez Perces Indians. The myths of Asia and Europe are
unhappily antipodal to this in spirit and form, telling of human beings
transformed to wolves. In the Norse Mythology, however, there stands a
demon wolf whose story bears a touch of feeling, though perhaps it was
originally the mere expression for physical law. This is the wolf
Fenris, which, from being at first the pet of the gods and lapdog of
the goddesses, became so huge and formidable that Asgard itself was
endangered. All the skill and power of the gods could not forge chains
which might chain him; he snapped them like straws and toppled over the
mountains to which he was fastened. But the little Elves working
underground <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb142" href="#v1pb142"
name="v1pb142">142</a>]</span>made that chain so fine that none could
see or feel it,&mdash;fashioned it out of the beards of women, the
breath of fish, noise of the cat&rsquo;s footfall, spittle of birds,
sinews of bears, roots of stones,&mdash;by which are meant things
non-existent. This held him. Fenris is chained till the final
destruction, when he shall break loose and devour Odin. The fine chain
that binds ferocity,&mdash;is it the love that can tame all creatures?
Is it the sunbeam that defines to the strongest creature its
habitat?</p>
<p>The two monsters formed when R&aacute;hu was cloven in twain, in
Hindu Mythology, reappear in Eddaic fable as the wolves Sk&ouml;ll and
Hati, who pursue the sun and moon. As it is said in the
V&ouml;lusp&aacute;:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">Euphemism attending propitiation of such monsters may
partly explain the many good things told of wolves in popular legend.
The stories of the she-wolf nourishing children, as Romulus and Remus,
are found in many lands. They must, indeed, have had some prestige, to
have been so largely adopted in saintly tradition. Like the bears that
Elisha called to devour the children, the wolves do not lose their
natural ferocity by becoming pious. They devour heretics and
sacrilegious people. One guarded the head of St. Edmund the Martyr of
England; another escorted St. Oddo, Abbot of Cluny, as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb143" href="#v1pb143" name=
"v1pb143">143</a>]</span>his ancestors did the priests of Cluny. The
skin of the wolf appears in folklore as a charm against hydrophobia;
its teeth are best for cutting children&rsquo;s gums, and its bite, if
survived, is an assurance against any future wound or pain.</p>

</div>
<p>The tragedy which is so foolishly sprung upon the nerves of
children, Little Red Riding-Hood, shows the wolf as a crafty animal.
There are many legends of a like character which have made it a
favourite figure in which to represent pious impostors. In our figure
10, the wolf appears as the &lsquo;dangerous confessor;&rsquo; it was
intended, as Mr. Wright thought, for Mary of Modena, Queen of James
II., and Father Petre. At the top of the original are the words
&lsquo;<i>Converte Angliam</i>&rsquo; and beneath, &lsquo;It is a
foolish sheep that makes the wolf her confessor.&rsquo; The craft of
the wolf is represented in a partly political partly social turn given
by an American fabulist to one of &AElig;sop&rsquo;s fables.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb144" href="#v1pb144" name=
"v1pb144">144</a>]</span>The wolf having accused the lamb he means to
devour of fouling the stream, and receiving answer that the lamb was
drinking farther down the current, alters the charge and says,
&lsquo;You opposed my candidature at the caucus two years ago.&rsquo;
&lsquo;I was not then born,&rsquo; replies the lamb. The wolf then
says, &lsquo;Any one hearing my accusations would testify that I am
insane and not responsible for my actions,&rsquo; and thereupon devours
the lamb with full faith in a jury of his countrymen. M. Toussenel says
the wolf is a terrible strategist, albeit the less observant have found
little in his character to warrant this attribute of craft, his
physiognomy and habits showing him a rather transparent highwayman. It
is probable that the fables of this character have derived that trait
from his association with demons and devils supposed to take on his
shape.</p>
<p>In a beautiful hymn to the Earth in the &lsquo;Atharva Veda&rsquo;
it is said, &lsquo;The Earth, which endureth the burden of the
oppressor, beareth up the abode of the lofty and of the lowly,
suffereth the hog, and giveth entrance to the wild boar.&rsquo;
Boar-hounds in Brittany and some other regions are still kept at
Government expense. There are many indications of this kind that in
early times men had to defend themselves vigorously against the ravages
of the wild boar, and, as De Gubernatis remarks,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e3609src" href="#xd20e3609" name="xd20e3609src">17</a> its
character is generally demoniacal. The contests of Hercules with the
Erymanthian, and of Meleager with the Calydonian, Boar, are enough to
show that it was through its dangerous character that he became sacred
to the gods of war, Mars and Odin. But it is also to be remembered that
the third incarnation of Vishnu was as a Wild Boar; and as the fearless
exterminator of snakes the pig merited this association with the
Preserver. Provided with a thick coat of fat, no venom can harm him
unless it be on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb145" href=
"#v1pb145" name="v1pb145">145</a>]</span>lip. It may be this ability to
defy the snake-ordeal which, after its uncleanliness had excepted the
hog from human voracity in some regions, assigned it a diabolical
character. In rabbinical fable the hog and rat were created by Noah to
clear the Ark of filth; but the rats becoming a nuisance, he evoked a
cat from the lion&rsquo;s nose.</p>
<p>It is clear that our Asiatic and Norse ancestors never had such a
ferocious beast to encounter as the Grisly Bear (<i lang="la">Ursus
horribilis</i>) of America, else the appearances of this animal in
Demonology could never have been so respectable. The comparatively
timid Asiatic Bear (<i lang="la">U. labiatus</i>), the small and almost
harmless Thibetan species (<i lang="la">U. Thibetanus</i>), would
appear to have preponderated over the fiercer but rarer Bears of the
North in giving us the Indo-Germanic fables, in which this animal is,
on the whole, a favourite. Emerson finds in the fondness of the English
for their national legend of &lsquo;Beauty and the Beast&rsquo; a sign
of the Englishman&rsquo;s own nature. &lsquo;He is a bear with a soft
place in his heart; he says No, and helps you.&rsquo; The old legend
found place in the heart of a particularly representative American
also&mdash;Theodore Parker, who loved to call his dearest friend
&lsquo;Bear,&rsquo; and who, on arriving in Europe, went to Berne to
see his favourites, from which its name is derived. The fondness of the
Bear for honey&mdash;whence its Russian name, <i>medv-jed</i>,
&lsquo;honey-eater&rsquo;&mdash;had probably something to do with its
dainty taste for roses and its admiration for female beauty, as told in
many myths. In his comparative treatment of the mythology of the Bear,
De Gubernatis<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3628src" href="#xd20e3628"
name="xd20e3628src">18</a> mentions the transformation of King
Trisankus into a bear, and connects this with the constellation of the
Great Bear; but it may with equal probability be related to the many
fables of princes who remain under the form of a bear <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb146" href="#v1pb146" name=
"v1pb146">146</a>]</span>until the spell is broken by the kiss of some
maiden. It is worthy of note that in the Russian legends the Bear is by
no means so amiable as in those of our Western folklore. In one, the
Bear-prince lurking in his fountain holds by the beard the king who,
while hunting, tries to quench his thirst, and releases him only after
a promise to deliver up whatever he has at home without his knowledge;
the twins, Ivan and Maria, born during his absence, are thus
doomed&mdash;are concealed, but discovered by the bear, who carries
them away. They are saved by help of the bull. When escaping the bear
Ivan throws down a comb, which becomes a tangled forest, which,
however, the bear penetrates; but the spread-out towel which becomes a
lake of fire sends the bear back.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3636src"
href="#xd20e3636" name="xd20e3636src">19</a> It is thus the ferocious
Arctic Bear which gives the story its sombre character. Such also is
the Russian tale of the Bear with iron hairs, which devastates the
kingdom, devouring the inhabitants until Ivan and Helena alone remain;
after the two in various ways try to escape, their success is secured
by the Bull, which, more kindly than Elisha, blinds the Bear with his
horns.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3639src" href="#xd20e3639" name=
"xd20e3639src">20</a> (The Bear retires in winter.) In Norwegian story
the Bear becomes milder,&mdash;a beautiful youth by night, whose wife
loses him because she wishes to see him by lamplight: her place is
taken by a long-nosed princess, until, by aid of the golden apple and
the rose, she recovers her husband. In the Pentameron,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e3642src" href="#xd20e3642" name=
"xd20e3642src">21</a> Pretiosa, to escape the persecutions of her
father, goes into the forest disguised as a she-bear; she nurses and
cures the prince, who is enamoured of her, and at his kiss becomes a
beautiful maid. The Bear thus has a twofold development in folklore. He
used to be killed (13th century) at the end of the Carnival in Rome, as
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb147" href="#v1pb147" name=
"v1pb147">147</a>]</span>Devil.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3647src"
href="#xd20e3647" name="xd20e3647src">22</a> The Siberians, if they
have killed a bear, hang his skin on a tree and apologise humbly to it,
declaring that they did not forge the metal that pierced it, and they
meant the arrow for a bird; from which it is plain that they rely more
on its stupidity than its good heart. In Canada, when the hunters kill
a bear, one of them approaches it and places between his teeth the stem
of his pipe, breathes in the bowl, and thus, filling with smoke the
animal&rsquo;s mouth, conjures its soul not to be offended at his
death. As the bear&rsquo;s ghost makes no reply, the huntsman, in order
to know if his prayer is granted, cuts the thread under the
bear&rsquo;s tongue, and keeps it until the end of the hunt, when a
large fire is kindled, and all the band solemnly throw in it what
threads of this kind they have; if these sparkle and vanish, as is
natural, it is a sign that the bears are appeased.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e3654src" href="#xd20e3654" name="xd20e3654src">23</a> In
Greenland the great demon, at once feared and invoked, especially by
fishermen, is Torngarsuk, a huge Bear with a human arm. He is invisible
to all except his priests, the Anguekkoks, who are the only physicians
of that people.</p>
<p>The extreme point of demonic power has always been held by the
Serpent. So much, however, will have to be said of the destructiveness
and other characteristics of this animal when we come to consider at
length its unique position in Mythology, that I content myself here
with a pictorial representation of the Singhalese Demon of Serpents. If
any one find himself shuddering at sight of a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb148" href="#v1pb148" name=
"v1pb148">148</a>]</span>snake, even in a country where they are few
and comparatively harmless, perhaps this figure (<a href=
"#v1fig11">11</a>) may suggest the final cause of the shudder.</p>
<div class="figure xd20e3666width" id="v1fig11"><img src=

</div>
<p>In conclusion, it may be said that not only every animal ferocity,
but every force which can be exerted injuriously, has had its demonic
representations. Every claw, fang, sting, hoof, horn, has been as
certain to be catalogued and labelled in demonology as in physical
science. It is remarkable also how superstition rationalises. Thus the
horn in the animal world, though sometimes dangerous to man, was more
dangerous to animals, which, as foes of the horned animals, were foes
to man&rsquo;s interests. The early herdsman knew the value of the horn
as a defence against dog and wolf, besides its other utilities.
Consequently, although it was necessary that the horn-principle, so to
say, in nature must be regarded as one of its retractile and cruel
features, man never demonised the animals whose butt was most
dangerous, but for such purpose transferred <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb149" href="#v1pb149" name=
"v1pb149">149</a>]</span>the horns to the head of some nondescript
creature. The horn has thus become a natural weapon of man-demons. The
same evolution has taken place in America; for, although among its
aboriginal legends we may meet with an occasional demon-buffalo, such
are rare and of apocryphal antiquity. The accompanying American figure
(<a href="#v1fig12">12</a>) is from a photograph sent me by the
President of Vanderbilt University, Tennessee, who found it in an old
mound (Red Indian) in the State of Georgia. It is probably as ancient
as any example of a human head with horns in the world; and as it could
not have been influenced by European notions, it supplies striking
evidence that the demonisation of the forces and dangers of nature
belongs to the structural action of the human mind.</p>

<p class="first">We paint the Devil black, says George Herbert. On the
other hand the negro paints him white, with reason enough. The name of
the Devil at Mozambique is Muzungu Maya, or Wicked White Man. Of this
demon they make little images of extreme hideousness, which are kept by
people on the coast, and occasionally displayed, in the belief that if
the White Devil is lurking near them he will vanish out of sheer
disgust with a glimpse of his own ugliness. The hereditary horror of
the kidnapper displayed in this droll superstition may possibly have
been assisted by the familiarity with all things infernal represented
in the language of the white sailors visiting the coast. Captain Basil
Hall, on visiting Mozambique about fifty years ago, found that the
native dignitaries had appropriated the titles of English noblemen, and
a dumpy little Duke of Devonshire met him with his whole vocabulary of
English,&mdash;&lsquo;How do you do, sir. Very glad see you. Damn your
eyes. Johanna man like English very much. God damn. That very good? Eh?
Devilish hot, sir. What news? Hope your ship stay too long while very.
Damn my eye. Very fine day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In most parts of India Siva also is painted white, which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb151" href="#v1pb151" name=
"v1pb151">151</a>]</span>would indicate that there too was found reason
to associate diabolism with the white face. It is said the Thugs spared
Englishmen because their white faces suggested relationship to Siva. In
some of the ancient Indian books the monster whom Indra slew, Vritra,
is called Dasyu (enemy), a name which in the Vedas designates the
Aborigines as contrasted with the Aryans of the North. &lsquo;In the
old Sanskrit, in the hymns of the Veda, &acirc;rya occurs frequently as
a national name and as a name of honour, comprising the worshippers of
the gods of the Brahmans, as opposed to their enemies, who are called
in the Veda Dasyus. Thus one of the gods, Indra, who in some respects
answers to the Greek Zeus, is invoked in the following words (Rigveda,
i. 57, 8):&mdash;&lsquo;Know thou the Aryas, O Indra, and those who are
Dasyus; punish the lawless, and deliver them unto thy servant! Be thou
the mighty helper of the worshippers, and I will praise all these thy
deeds at the festivals.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3702src"
href="#xd20e3702" name="xd20e3702src">1</a></p>
<p>Naglok (snakeland) was at an early period a Hindu name for hell. But
the Nagas were not real snakes,&mdash;in that case they might have
fared better,&mdash;but an aboriginal tribe in Ceylon, believed by the
Hindus to be of serpent origin,&mdash;&lsquo;naga&rsquo; being an
epithet for &lsquo;native.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3707src"
href="#xd20e3707" name="xd20e3707src">2</a> The Singhalese, on the
other hand, have adapted the popular name for demons in India,
&lsquo;Rakshasa,&rsquo; in their <i>Rakseyo</i>, a tribe of invisible
cannibals without supernatural powers (except invisibility), who no
doubt merely embody the traditions of some early race. The dreaded
powers were from another tribe designated Yakkhos (demons), and
believed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb152" href="#v1pb152" name=
"v1pb152">152</a>]</span>to have the power of rendering themselves
invisible. Buddha&rsquo;s victories over these demonic beings are
related in the &lsquo;Mahawanso.&rsquo; &lsquo;It was known (by
inspiration) by the vanquishers that in Lanka, filled by yakkhos, ...
would be the place where his religion would be glorified. In like
manner, knowing that in the centre of Lanka, on the delightful bank of
a river, ... in the agreeable Mahanaga garden, ... there was a great
assembly of the principal yakkhos, ... the deity of happy advent,
approaching that great congregation, ... immediately over their heads
hovering in the air, ... struck terror into them by rains, tempests,
and darkness. The yakkhos, overwhelmed with awe, supplicated of the
vanquisher to be released from their terror.... The consoling
vanquisher thus replied: &lsquo;I will release ye yakkhos from this
your terror and affliction: give ye unto me here by unanimous consent a
place for me to alight on.&rsquo; All these yakkhos replied:
&lsquo;Lord, we confer on thee the whole of Lanka, grant thou comfort
to us.&rsquo; The vanquisher thereupon dispelling their terror and cold
shivering, and spreading his carpet of skin on the spot bestowed on
him, he there seated himself. He then caused the aforesaid carpet,
refulgent with a fringe of flames, to extend itself on all sides: they,
scorched by the flames, (receding) stood around on the shores (of the
island) terrified. The Saviour then caused the delightful isle of Giri
to approach for them. As soon as they transferred themselves thereto
(to escape the conflagration), he restored it to its former
position.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3715src" href="#xd20e3715"
name="xd20e3715src">3</a></p>
<p>This legend, which reminds one irresistibly of the expulsion of
reptiles by saints from Ireland, and other Western regions, is the more
interesting if it be considered that these Yakkhos are the Sanskrit
Yakshas, attendants <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb153" href=
"#v1pb153" name="v1pb153">153</a>]</span>on Kuvera, the god of wealth,
employed in the care of his garden and treasures. They are regarded as
generally inoffensive. The transfer by English authorities of the
Tasmanians from their native island to another, with the result of
their extermination, may suggest the possible origin of the story of
Giri.</p>
<p>Buddha&rsquo;s dealings with the serpent-men or nagas is related as
follows in the same volume:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The vanquisher (<i>i.e.</i>, of the five deadly sins), ... in
the fifth year of his buddhahood, while residing at the garden of (the
prince) Jeto, observing that, on account of a disputed claim for a
gem-set throne between the naga Mahodaro and a similar Chalodaro, a
maternal uncle and nephew, a conflict was at hand, ... taking with him
his sacred dish and robes, out of compassion to the nagas, visited
Nagadipo.... These mountain nagas were, moreover, gifted with
supernatural powers.... The Saviour and dispeller of the darkness of
sin, poising himself in the air over the centre of the assembly, caused
a terrifying darkness to these nagas. Attending to the prayer of the
dismayed nagas, he again called forth the light of day. They, overjoyed
at having seen the deity of felicitous advent, bowed down at the feet
of the divine teacher. To them the vanquisher preached a sermon of
reconciliation. Both parties rejoicing thereat, made an offering of the
gem-throne to the divine sage. The divine teacher, alighting on the
earth, seated himself on the throne, and was served by the naga kings
with celestial food and beverage. The lord of the universe procured for
eighty kotis of nagas, dwelling on land and in the waters, the
salvation of the faith and the state of piety.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At every step in the conversion of the native Singhalese,&mdash;the
demons and serpent-men,&mdash;Buddha and his apostles are represented
as being attended by the <i>devas</i>,&mdash;the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb154" href="#v1pb154" name=
"v1pb154">154</a>]</span>deities of India,&mdash;who are spoken of as
if glad to become menials of the new religion. But we find Zoroaster
using this term in a demonic sense, and describing alien worshippers as
children of the Devas (a Semite would say, Sons of Belial). And in the
conventional Persian pictures of the Last Judgment (moslem), the
archfiend has the Hindu complexion. A similar phenomenon may be
observed in various regions. In the medi&aelig;val frescoes of Moscow,
representing infernal tortures, it is not very difficult to pick out
devils representing the physical characteristics of most of the races
with which the Muscovite has struggled in early times. There are also
black Ethiopians among them, which may be a result of devils being
considered the brood of Tchernibog, god of Darkness; but may also, not
impossibly, have come of such apocryphal narratives as that ascribed to
St. Augustine. &lsquo;I was already Bishop of Hippo when I went into
Ethiopia with some servants of Christ, there to preach the gospel. In
this country we saw many men and women without heads, who had two great
eyes in their breasts; and in countries still more southerly we saw a
people who had but one eye in their foreheads.&rsquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e3736src" href="#xd20e3736" name="xd20e3736src">4</a></p>
<p>In considering animal demons, the primitive demonisation of the Wolf
has been discussed. But it is mainly as a transformation of man and a
type of savage foes that this animal has been a prominent figure in
Mythology.</p>
<p>Professor Max M&uuml;ller has made it tolerably clear that
Bellerophon means Slayer of the Hairy; and that Belleros is the
transliteration of Sanskrit <i>varvara</i>, a term applied to the dark
Aborigines by their Aryan invaders, equivalent to barbarians.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e3750src" href="#xd20e3750" name="xd20e3750src">5</a>
This points us for the origin of the title rather to
Bellerophon&rsquo;s conquest of the Lycians, or Wolf-men, than to his
victory over the Chim&aelig;ra. The story of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb155" href="#v1pb155" name=
"v1pb155">155</a>]</span>Lycaon and his sons&mdash;barbarians defying
the gods and devouring human flesh&mdash;turned into wolves by Zeus,
connects itself with the Lycians (hairy, wolfish barbarians), whom
Bellerophon conquered.</p>
<p>It was not always, however, the deity that conquered in such
encounters. In the myth of Soracte, the Wolf is seen able to hold his
own against the gods. Soranus, worshipped on Mount Soracte, was at Rome
the god of Light, and is identified with Apollo by Virgil.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e3757src" href="#xd20e3757" name="xd20e3757src">6</a>
A legend states that he became associated with the infernal gods,
though called Diespiter, because of the sulphurous exhalations from the
side of Mount Soracte. It is said that once when some shepherds were
performing a sacrifice, some wolves seized the flesh; the shepherds,
following them, were killed by the poisonous vapours of the mountain to
which the wolves retreated. An oracle gave out that this was a
punishment for their pursuing the sacred animals; and a general
pestilence also having followed, it was declared that it could only
cease if the people were all changed to wolves and lived by prey. Hence
the Hirpini, from the Sabine &lsquo;<i>hirpus</i>,&rsquo; a wolf. The
story is a variant of that of the Hirpinian Samnites, who were said to
have received their name from their ancestors having followed a sacred
wolf when seeking their new home. The Wolf ceremonies were, like the
Roman Lupercalia, for purposes of purification. The worshippers ran
naked through blazing fires. The annual festival, which Strabo
describes as occurring in the grove of Feronia, goddess of Nature,
became at last a sort of fair. Its history, however, is very
significant of the formidable character of the Hirpini, or Wolf-tribe,
which could alone have given rise to such euphemistic celebrations of
the wolf.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that in some regions this wolf
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb156" href="#v1pb156" name=
"v1pb156">156</a>]</span>of superstition was domesticated into a dog.
Pierius says there was a temple of Vulcan in Mount &AElig;tna, in whose
grove were dogs that fawned on the pious, but rent the polluted
worshippers. It will be seen by the left form of <a href=
"#v1fig13">Fig. 13</a> that the wolf had a diminution, in pictorial
representation similar to that which the canine Lares underwent (p.
135). This picture is referred by John Beaumont<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e3773src" href="#xd20e3773" name="xd20e3773src">7</a> to
Cartarius&rsquo; work on &lsquo;The Images of the Gods of the
Ancients;&rsquo; the form wearing a wolf&rsquo;s skin and head is that
of the demon Polites, who infested Temesa in Italy, according to a
story related by Pausanias. Ulysses, in his wanderings, having come to
this town, one of his companions was stoned to death for having
ravished a virgin; after which his ghost appeared in form of this
demon, which had to be appeased, by the direction of the oracle of
Apollo, by the annual sacrifice to him of the most beautiful virgin in
the place. Euthymus, enamoured of a virgin about to be so offered, gave
battle to this demon, and, having expelled him from the country,
married the virgin. However, since the infernal powers cannot be
deprived of their rights without substitution, this saviour of Temesa
disappeared in the river C&aelig;cinus.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Fig. 13.&mdash;<span class="sc">Italian and Roman

</div>
<p>The form on the right in <a href="#v1fig13">Fig. 13</a> represents
the genius of the city of Rome, and is found on some of Hadrian&rsquo;s
coins; he holds the cornucopia and the sacrificial dish. The child and
the serpent in the same picture represent the origin of the demonic
character attributed to the Eleans by the Arcadians. This
child-and-serpent symbol, which bears resemblance to certain variants
of Bel and the Dragon, no doubt was brought to Elea, or Velia in Italy,
by the Phoc&aelig;ans, when they abandoned their Ionian homes rather
than submit to Cyrus, and founded that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb157" href="#v1pb157" name="v1pb157">157</a>]</span>town,
<span class="sc">B.C.</span> 544. The two forms were jointly worshipped
with annual sacrifices in the temple of Lucina, under the name
Sosipolis. The legend of this title is related by Pausanias. When the
Arcadians invaded the Eleans, a woman came to the Elean commander with
an infant at her breast, and said that she had been admonished in a
dream to place her child in front of the army. This was done; as the
Arcadians approached the child was changed to a serpent, and, astounded
at the prodigy, they fled without giving battle. The child was
represented by the Eleans decorated with stars, and holding the
cornucopia; by the Arcadians, no doubt, in a less celestial way. It is
not uncommon in Mythology to find the most dangerous demons represented
under some guise of weakness, as, for instance, among the South
Africans, some of whom recently informed English officers that the
Galeikas were led against them by a terrible sorcerer in the form of a
hare. The most fearful traditional demon ever slain by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb158" href="#v1pb158" name=
"v1pb158">158</a>]</span>hero in Japan was Shuden Dozi&mdash;the
Child-faced Drinker. In Ceylon the apparition of a demon is said to be
frequently under the form of a woman with a child in her arms.</p>
<p>Many animal demons are mere fables for the ferocity of human tribes.
The Were-wolf superstition, which exists still in Russia, where the
transformed monster is called <i>volkodl&aacute;k</i> (<i>volk</i>, a
wolf, and <i>dlak</i>, hair), might even have originated in the costume
of Norse barbarians and huntsmen. The belief was always more or less
rationalised, resembling that held by Verstegan three hundred years
ago, and which may be regarded as prevalent among both the English and
Flemish people of his day. &lsquo;These Were-wolves,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;are certain sorcerers, who, having anointed their bodies with an
ointment they make by the instinct of the devil, and putting on a
certain enchanted girdle, do not only unto the view of others seem as
wolves, but to their own thinking have both the nature and shape of
wolves so long as they wear the said girdle; and they do dispose
themselves as very wolves, in worrying and killing, and waste of human
creatures.&rsquo; During the Franco-German war of 1870&ndash;71, a
family of ladies on the German side of the Rhine, sitting up all night
in apprehension, related to me such stories of the &lsquo;Turcos&rsquo;
that I have since found no difficulty in understanding the belief in
weird and pr&aelig;ternatural wolves which once filled Europe with
horror. The facility with which the old Lycian wolf-girdle, so to say,
was caught up and worn in so many countries where race-wars were
chronic for many ages, renders it nearly certain that this superstition
(Lycanthropy), however it may have originated, was continued through
the custom of ascribing demonic characteristics to hostile and fierce
races. It has been, indeed, a general opinion that the theoretical
belief originated in the Pythagorean doctrine of metempsychosis. Thus
Shakspere:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb159" href=
"#v1pb159" name="v1pb159">159</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="line">Infused itself in thee; for thy desires</p>
<p class="line">Are wolfish, bloody, starved, and ravenous.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But the superstition is much older than Pythagoras,
who, no doubt, tried to turn it into a moral theory of
retributions,&mdash;as indeed did Plato in his story of the Vision of
Er the Armenian.</p>
<p>Professor Weber and others have adduced evidence indicating that
although belief in the transformation of men into beasts was not
developed in the Vedic age of India, the matrix of it was there. But of
our main fact&mdash;the association of demonic characters with certain
tribes&mdash;India has presented many examples. In the mountains of
Travancore there are tribes which are still generally believed to be on
terms of especial familiarity with the devils of that region; and the
dwellers on the plains relate that on these mountains gigantic demons,
sixteen or seventeen feet high, may sometimes be seen hurling
firebrands at each other.</p>
<p>Professor Monier Williams contributes an interesting note concerning
this general phase of South-Indian demonology. &lsquo;Furthermore, it
must not be forgotten that although a belief in devils and homage to
bhutas, or spirits, of all kinds is common all over India, yet what is
called devil-worship is far more systematically practised in the South
of India and Ceylon than in the North. And the reason may be that as
the invading Aryans advanced towards Southern India, they found
portions of it peopled by wild aboriginal savages, whose <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb160" href="#v1pb160" name=
"v1pb160">160</a>]</span>behaviour and aspect appeared to them to
resemble that of devils. The Aryan mind, therefore, naturally pictured
to itself the regions of the South as the chief resort and stronghold
of the demon race, and the dread of demonical agency became more deeply
rooted in Southern India than in the North. Curiously enough, too, it
is commonly believed in Southern India that every wicked man
contributes by his death to swell the ever-increasing ranks of devil
legions. His evil passions do not die with him; they are intensified,
concentrated, and perpetuated in the form of a malignant and
mischievous spirit.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3837src" href=
"#xd20e3837" name="xd20e3837src">8</a></p>
<p>It is obvious that this principle may be extended from individuals
to entire tribes. The Cimmerians were regarded as dwelling in a land
allied with hell. In the legend of the Alhambra, as told by Washington
Irving, the astrologer warns the Moorish king that the beautiful damsel
is no doubt one of those Gothic sorceresses of whom they have heard so
much. Although, as we have seen, England was regarded on the Continent
as an island of demons because of its northern latitude, probably some
of its tribes were of a character dangerous enough to prolong the
superstition. The nightmare elves were believed to come from England,
and to hurry away through the keyholes at daybreak, saying &lsquo;The
bells are calling in England.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e3842src" href="#xd20e3842" name="xd20e3842src">9</a> Visigoth
probably left us our word <i>bigot</i>; and &lsquo;Goths and
Vandals&rsquo; sometimes designate English roughs, as
&lsquo;Turks&rsquo; those of Constantinople. Herodotus says the
Scythians of the Black Sea regarded the Neurians as wizards, who
transformed themselves into wolves <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb161" href="#v1pb161" name="v1pb161">161</a>]</span>for a few days
annually; but the Scythians themselves are said by Herodotus to have
sprung from a monster, half-woman half-serpent; and possibly the
association of the Scotch with the Scythians by the Germans, who called
them both <i>Scutten</i>, had something to do with the uncanny
character ascribed to the British Isles. Sir Walter Raleigh described
the Red Men of America as gigantic monsters. &lsquo;Red Devils&rsquo;
is still the pioneer&rsquo;s epithet for them in the Far West. The
hairy Dukes of Esau were connected with the goat, and demonised as
Edom; and Ishmael was not believed much better by the more peaceful
Semitic tribes. Such notions are akin to those which many now have of
the Thugs and Bashi-Bazouks, and are too uniform and natural to tax
much the ingenuity of Comparative Mythology.</p>
<p>Underlying many of the legends of giants and dwarfs may be found a
similar demonologic formation. A principle of natural selection would
explain the existence of tribes, which, though of small stature, are
able to hold their own against the larger and more powerful by their
superior cunning. That such equalisation of apparently unequal forces
has been known in pre-historic ages may be gathered from many fables.
Before Bali, the monarch already mentioned, whose power alarmed the
gods themselves, Vishnu appeared as a dwarf, asking only so much land
as he could measure with three steps; the apparently ridiculous request
granted, the god strode over the whole earth with two steps and brought
his third on the head of Bali. In Scandinavian fable we have the young
giantess coming to her mother with the plough and ploughman in her
apron, which she had picked up in the field. To her child&rsquo;s
inquiry, &lsquo;What sort of beetle is this I found wriggling in the
sand?&rsquo; the giantess replies, &lsquo;Go put it back in the place
where thou hast found it. We <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb162"
href="#v1pb162" name="v1pb162">162</a>]</span>must be gone out of this
land, for these little people will dwell in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Sagas contain many stories which, while written in glorification
of the &lsquo;giant&rsquo; race, relate the destruction of their chiefs
by the magical powers of the dwarfs. I must limit myself to a few notes
on the Ynglinga Saga. &lsquo;In Swithiod,&rsquo; we are told,
&lsquo;are many great domains, and many wonderful races of men, and
many kinds of languages. There are giants, and there are dwarfs, and
there are also blue men. There are wild beasts, and dreadfully large
dragons.&rsquo; We learn that in Asaland was a great chief, Odin, who
went out to conquer Vanaland. The Vanalanders are declared to have
magic arts,&mdash;such as are ascribed to Finns and Lapps to this day
by the more ignorant of their neighbours. But that the people of
Asaland learned their magic charms. &lsquo;Odin was the cleverest of
them all, and from him all the others learned their magic arts.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Odin could make his enemies in battle blind, or deaf, or
terror-struck, and their weapons so blunt that they could no more cut
than a willow twig; on the other hand, his men rushed forward without
armour, were as mad as dogs or wolves, bit their shields, and were as
strong as bears or wild bulls, and killed people at a blow, and neither
fire nor iron told upon them. These were called Berserkers.&rsquo;
(From <i>ber</i>, bear, and <i>serkr</i>, sark or coat; the word being
probably, as Maurer says, a survival of an earlier belief in the
transformation of men into bears.) But the successors of Odin did not
preserve his occult power. Svegdir, for instance, saw a large stone and
a dwarf at the door entering in it. The dwarf called him to come in and
he should see Odin. &lsquo;Swedger ran into the stone, which instantly
closed behind him, and Swedger never came back.&rsquo; The witchcraft
of the Finn people is said to have led Vanlandi (Svegdir&rsquo;s son)
to his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb163" href="#v1pb163" name=
"v1pb163">163</a>]</span>death by Mara (night-mare). Vanlandi&rsquo;s
son too, Visbur, fell a victim to sorcery. Such legends as these, and
many others which may be found in Sturleson&rsquo;s Heimskringla, have
influenced our popular stories whose interest turns on the skill with
which some little Jack or Thumbling overcomes his adversary by superior
cunning.</p>
<p>Superstitions concerning dwarf-powers are especially rife in
Northumberland, where they used to be called <i>Duergar</i>, and they
were thought to abound on the hills between Rothbury and Elsdon. They
mislead with torches. One story relates that a traveller, beguiled at
night into a hut where a dwarf prepared a comfortable fire for him,
found himself when daylight returned sitting upon the edge of a deep
rugged precipice, where the slightest movement had caused him to be
dashed to pieces.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3894src" href="#xd20e3894"
name="xd20e3894src">10</a> The Northumbrian stories generally, however,
do not bear the emphasis of having grown out of aboriginal conditions,
or even of having been borrowed for such. The legends of Scotland, and
of the South-West of England, appear to me much more suggestive of
original struggles between large races and small. They are recalled by
the superstitions which still linger in Norway concerning the Lapps,
who are said to carry on unholy dealings with gnomes.</p>
<p>In the last century the &lsquo;Brownie&rsquo; was commonly spoken of
in Scotland as appearing in shape of &lsquo;a tall man,&rsquo; and the
name seems to refer to the <i>brown</i> complexion of that bogey, and
its long brown hair, hardly Scottish.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e3902src" href="#xd20e3902" name="xd20e3902src">11</a> It is
generally the case that Second Sight, which once attained the dignity
of being called &lsquo;Deuteroscopia,&rsquo; sees a doomed man or woman
shrink to the size of a dwarf. The &lsquo;tall man&rsquo; is not far
off in such cases. &lsquo;In some age of the world more remote than
even that of Alypos,&rsquo; says <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb164"
href="#v1pb164" name="v1pb164">164</a>]</span>Hugh Miller, &lsquo;the
whole of Britain was peopled by giants&mdash;a fact amply supported by
early English historians and the traditions of the North of Scotland.
Diocletian, king of Syria, say the historians, had thirty-three
daughters, who, like the daughters of Danaus, killed their husbands on
their wedding night. The king, their father, in abhorrence of the
crime, crowded them all into a ship, which he abandoned to the mercy of
the waves, and which was drifted by tides and winds till it arrived on
the coast of Britain, then an uninhabited island. There they lived
solitary, subsisting on roots and berries, the natural produce of the
soil, until an order of demons, becoming enamoured of them, took them
for their wives; and a tribe of giants, who must be regarded as the
true aborigines of the country, if indeed the demons have not a prior
claim, were the fruit of these marriages. Less fortunate, however, than
even their prototypes the Cyclops, the whole tribe was extirpated a few
ages after by Brutus the parricide, who, with a valour to which mere
bulk could offer no effectual resistance, overthrew Gog-Magog and
Termagol, and a whole host of others with names equally terrible.
Tradition is less explicit than the historians in what relates to the
origin and extinction of the race, but its narratives of their prowess
are more minute. There is a large and ponderous stone in the parish of
Edderston which a giantess of the tribe is said to have flung from the
point of a spindle across the Dornoch Firth; and another, within a few
miles of Dingwall, still larger and more ponderous, which was thrown by
a person of the same family, and which still bears the marks of a
gigantic finger and thumb.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3907src"
href="#xd20e3907" name="xd20e3907src">12</a></p>
<p>Perhaps we may find the mythological descendants of these Titans,
and also of the Druids, in the so-called <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb165" href="#v1pb165" name="v1pb165">165</a>]</span>&lsquo;Great
Men&rsquo; once dreaded by Highlanders. The natives of South Uist
believed that a valley, called Glenslyte, situated between two
mountains on the east side of the island, was haunted by these Great
Men, and that if any one entered the valley without formally resigning
themselves to the conduct of those beings, they would infallibly become
mad. Martin, having remonstrated with the people against this
superstition, was told of a woman&rsquo;s having come out of the valley
a lunatic because she had not uttered the spell of three sentences.
They also told him of voices heard in the air. The Brownie (&lsquo;a
tall man with very long brown hair&rsquo;), who has cow&rsquo;s milk
poured out for him on a hill in the same region, probably of this giant
tribe, might easily have been demonised at the time when the Druids
were giving St. Columba so much trouble, and trying to retain their
influence over the people by professing supernatural powers.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e3914src" href="#xd20e3914" name=
"xd20e3914src">13</a></p>
<p>The man of the smaller stature, making up for his inferiority by
invention, perhaps first forged the sword, the coat of mail, and the
shield, and so confronted the giant with success. The god with the
Hammer might thus supersede the god of the Flint Spear. Magic art
seemed to have rendered invulnerable the man from whom the arrow
rebounded.</p>
<p>It would appear from King Olaf Tryggvason&rsquo;s Saga that nine
hundred years ago the Icelanders and the Danes reciprocally regarded
each other as giants and dwarfs. The Icelanders indited lampoons
against the Danes which allude to their diminutive size:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The gallant Harald in the field</p>
<p class="line">Between his legs lets drop his shield,</p>
<p class="line">Into a pony he was changed, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="first">On the other hand, the Danes had by no means a
contemptuous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb166" href="#v1pb166"
name="v1pb166">166</a>]</span>idea of their Icelandic enemies, as the
following narrative from Heimskringla proves. &lsquo;King Harald told a
warlock to hie to Iceland in some altered shape, and to try what he
could learn there to tell him: and he set out in the shape of a whale.
And when he came near to the land he went to the west side of Iceland,
north around the land, when he saw all the mountains and hills full of
land-serpents, some great, some small. When he came to Vapnafiord he
went in towards the land, intending to go on shore; but a huge dragon
rushed down the dale against him, with a train of serpents, paddocks,
and toads, that blew poison towards him. Then he turned to go westward
around the land as far as Eyafiord, and he went into the fiord. Then a
bird flew against him, which was so great that its wings stretched over
the mountains on either side of the fiord, and many birds, great and
small, with it. Then he swam further west, and then south into
Breidafiord. When he came into the fiord a large grey bull ran against
him, wading into the sea, and bellowing fearfully, and he was followed
by a crowd of land-serpents. From thence he went round by Reikaness and
wanted to land at Vikarsted, but there came down a hill-giant against
him with an iron staff in his hands. He was a head higher than the
mountains, and many other giants followed him.&rsquo; The most
seductive Hesperian gardens of the South and East do not appear to have
been so thoroughly guarded or defended as Iceland, and one can hardly
call it cowardice when (after the wizard-whale brought back the log of
its voyage) it is recorded: &lsquo;Then the Danish king turned about
with his fleet and sailed back to Denmark.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is a sufficiently curious fact that the Mimacs, aborigines of
Nova Scotia,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3934src" href="#xd20e3934"
name="xd20e3934src">14</a> were found with a whale-story, already
referred to (p. 46), so much like this. They also <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb167" href="#v1pb167" name=
"v1pb167">167</a>]</span>have the legend of an ancient warrior named
Booin, who possessed the pr&aelig;ternatural powers especially ascribed
to Odin, those of raising storms, causing excessive cold, increasing or
diminishing his size, and assuming any shape. Besides the fearful race
of gigantic ice-demons dreaded by this tribe, as elsewhere stated (p.
84), they dread also a yellow-horned dragon called Cheepichealm, (whose
form the great Booin sometimes assumes). They make offerings to the new
moon. They believe in pixies, calling them Wigguladum-moochkik,
&lsquo;very little people.&rsquo; They anciently believed in two great
spirits, good and evil, both called Manitoos; since their contact with
christians only the evil one has been so called.</p>
<p>The entire <i>motif</i> of the Mimac Demonology is, to my mind, that
of early conflicts with some formidable races. It is to be hoped that
travellers will pay more attention to this unique race before it has
ceased to exist. The Chinese theory of genii is almost exactly that of
the Mimacs. The Chinese genii are now small as a moth, now fill the
world; can assume any form; they command demons; they never die, but,
at the end of some centuries, ride to heaven on a dragon&rsquo;s
back.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e3944src" href="#xd20e3944" name=
"xd20e3944src">15</a> Ordinarily the Chinese genii use the yellow heron
as an aerial courser. The Mimacs believe in a large pr&aelig;ternatural
water-bird, Culloo, which devours ordinary people, but bears on its
back those who can tame it by magic.</p>
<p>Mr. Mayers, in his &lsquo;Chinese Reader&rsquo;s Manual,&rsquo;
suggests that the designation of Formosa as &lsquo;Isles of the
Genii&rsquo; (San Sh&eacute;n Shan) by the Chinese, has some reference
to their early attempts at colonisation in Japan. Su Fuh, a
necromancer, who lived B.C. 219, is said to have announced their
discovery, and at the head of a troop of young men and maidens, voyaged
with an expedition towards them, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb168"
href="#v1pb168" name="v1pb168">168</a>]</span>but, when within sight of
the magic islands, were driven back by contrary winds.</p>
<p>Gog and Magog stand in London Guildhall, though much diminished in
stature, to suit the English muscles that had to bear them in
processions, monuments of the pr&aelig;ternatural size attributed to
the enemies which the Aryan race encountered in its great westward
migrations. Even to-day, when the progress of civilisation is harassed
by untamed Scythian hordes, how strangely fall upon our ears the
ancient legends and prophecies concerning them!</p>

verily Gog and Magog waste the land; shall we, therefore, pay thee
tribute, on condition that thou build a rampart between us and them? He
answered, The power wherewith my Lord hath strengthened me is better

Gog and Magog could not scale it, neither could they dig through it.

inconsistent habits. &lsquo;Thy inebriety is most intense,&rsquo;

both thy inebriety and thy beneficence should be the means of
destroying enemies and distributing riches.&rsquo;<a class="noteref"

famine is invoked the thunderbolt of Indra, and it is likened to the

appeared to the terror of gods and men.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e4016src" href="#xd20e4016" name="xd20e4016src">2</a> This
Tvashtri was not an evil being himself, but, as we have seen, an
artificer for the gods similar to Vulcan; he was, however, father of a
three-headed monster who has been identified with Vritra. Though these
early worshippers recognised that their chief trouble was connected
with &lsquo;glaring heat&rsquo; (which Tvashtri seems to mean in the
passage just referred to), Indra&rsquo;s celebrants beheld him
superseding his father Dyaus, and reigning in the day&rsquo;s splendour
as well as in the cloud&rsquo;s bounty. This monopolist of parts in

the deadly strangling serpent Ahi, especial type of Drouth as it dries
up rivers; and through all these combats with the alleged authors of
the recurring Barrenness and Famine, as most of these monsters were,
the seat of the evil was the Sun-god&rsquo;s adorable self!</p>
<p>Almost pathetic does the long and vast history appear just now, when
competent men of science are giving us good reason to believe that
right knowledge of the sun, and the relation of its spots to the
rainfall, might have covered India with ways and means which would have
adapted the entire realm to its environment, and wrested from Indra his
hostile thunderbolt&mdash;the sunstroke of famine. The Hindus have
covered their lands with temples raised to propitiate and deprecate the
demons, and to invoke the deities against such sources of drouth and
famine. Had they concluded that famine was the result of inexactly
quartered sun-dials, the land would have been covered with perfect
sun-dials; but the famine would have been more destructive, because of
the increasing withdrawal of mind and energy from the true cause, and
its implied answer. Even so were conflagrations in London attributed to
inexact city clocks; the clocks would become perfect, the
conflagrations more numerous, through misdirection of vigilance. But
how much wiser are we of Christendom than the Hindus? <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb172" href="#v1pb172" name=
"v1pb172">172</a>]</span>They have adapted their country perfectly for
propitiation of famine-demons that do not exist, at a cost which would
long ago have rendered them secure from the famine-forces that do
exist. We have similarly covered Christendom with a complete system of
securities against hells and devils and wrathful deities that do not
exist, while around our churches, chapels, cathedrals, are the
actually-existent seething hells of pauperism, shame, and crime.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing can advance art in any district of this accursed
machine-and-devil-driven England until she changes her mind in many
things.&rsquo; So wrote John Ruskin recently. Of course, so long as the
machine toils and earns wealth and other power which still goes to
support and further social and ecclesiastical forms, constituted with
reference to salvation from a devil or demons no longer believed in,
the phrase &lsquo;machine-and-devil-driven&rsquo; is true. Until the
invention and enterprise of the nation are administered in the interest
of right ideas, we may still sigh, like John Sterling, for &lsquo;a
dozen men to stand up for ideas as Cobden and his friends do for
machinery.&rsquo; But it still remains as true that all the machinery
and wealth of England devoted to man might make its every home happy,
and educate every inhabitant, as that every idolatrous temple in India
might be commuted into a shield against famine.</p>
<p>Our astronomers and economists have enabled us to see clearly how
the case is with the country whose temples offer no obstruction to
christian vision. The facts point to the conclusion that the sun-spots
reach their maximum and minimum of intensity at intervals of eleven
years, and that their high activity is attended with frequent
fluctuations of the magnetic needle, and increased rainfall. In 1811,
and since then, famines in India have, with one <span class=

"v1pb173">173</a>]</span>exception, followed years of minimum
sun-spots.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4034src" href="#xd20e4034" name=
"xd20e4034src">4</a> These facts are sufficiently well attested to
warrant the belief that English science and skill will be able to
realise in India the provision which Joseph is said to have made for
the seven lean years of which Pharaoh dreamed.</p>
<p>Until that happy era shall arrive, the poor Hindus will only go on
alternately adoring and propitiating the sun, as its benign or its
cruel influences shall fall upon them. The artist Turner said,
&lsquo;The sun is God.&rsquo; The superb effects of light in
Turner&rsquo;s pictures could hardly have come from any but a
sun-worshipper dwelling amid fogs. Unfamiliarity often breeds
reverence. There are few countries in which the sun, when it does
shine, is so likely to be greeted with enthusiasm, and observed in all
its variations of splendour, as one in which its appearance is rare.
Yet the superstition inherited from regions where the sun is equally a
desolation was strong enough to blot out its glory in the mind of a
writer famous in his time, Tobias Swinden, M.A., who wrote a work to
prove the sun to be the abode of the damned.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e4039src" href="#xd20e4039" name="xd20e4039src">5</a> The
speculation may now appear only curious, but, probably, it is no more
curious than a hundred years from now will seem to all the vulgar
notion of future fiery torments for mankind, the scriptural necessity
of which led the fanciful rector to his grotesque conclusion. These two
extremes&mdash;the Sun-worship of Turner, the Sun-horror of
Swinden,&mdash;survivals in England, represent the two antagonistic
aspects of the sun, which were of overwhelming import to those who
dwelt beneath its greatest potency. His ill-humour, or his hunger and
thirst, in any year transformed the earth to a desert, and dealt death
to thousands.</p>
<p>In countries where drouth, barrenness, and consequent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb174" href="#v1pb174" name=
"v1pb174">174</a>]</span>famine were occasional, as in India, it would
be an inevitable result that they would represent the varying moods of
a powerful will, and in such regions we naturally find the most
extensive appliances for propitiation. The preponderant number of fat
years would tell powerfully on the popular imagination in favour of
priestly intercession, and the advantage of sacrifices to the great
Hunger-demon who sometimes consumed the seeds of the earth. But in
countries where barrenness was an ever-present, visible, unvarying
fact, the Demon of the Desert would represent Necessity, a power not to
be coaxed or changed. People dwelling in distant lands might invent
theoretical myths to account for the desert. It might be an accident
resulting from the Sun-god having given up his chariot one day to an
inexperienced driver who came too close to the earth. But to those who
lived beside the desert it could only seem an infernal realm, quite
irrecoverable. The ancient civilisation of Egypt, so full of grandeur,
might, in good part, have been due to the lesson taught them by the
desert, that they could not change the conditions around them by any
entreaties, but must make the best of what was left. If such, indeed,
was the force that built the ancient civilisation whose monuments
remain so magnificent in their ruins, its decay might be equally
accounted for when that primitive faith passed into a theological
phase. For as Necessity is the mother of invention, Fate is fatal to
the same. Belief in facts, and laws fixed in the organic nature of
things, stimulates man to study them and constitute his life with
reference to them; but belief that things are fixed by the arbitrary
decree of an individual power is the final sentence of enterprise. Fate
might thus steadily bring to ruin the grandest achievements of
Necessity.</p>
<p>Had we only the true history of the Sphinx&mdash;the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb175" href="#v1pb175" name=
"v1pb175">175</a>]</span>Binder&mdash;we might find it a landmark
between the rise and decline of Egyptian civilisation. When the great
Limitation surrounding the powers of man was first personified with
that mystical grandeur, it would stand in the desert not as the riddle
but its solution. No such monument was ever raised by Doubt. But once
personified and outwardly shaped, the external Binder must bind thought
as well; nay, will throttle thought if it cannot pierce through the
stone and discover the meaning of it. &lsquo;How true is that old fable
of the Sphinx who sat by the wayside propounding her riddle to the
passengers, which if they could not answer she destroyed them! Such a
Sphinx is this Life of ours to all men and societies of men. Nature,
like the Sphinx, is of womanly celestial loveliness and tenderness; the
face and bosom of a goddess, but ending in claws and the body of a
lioness. There is in her a celestial beauty,&mdash;which means
celestial order, pliancy to wisdom; but there is also a darkness, a
ferocity, fatality, which are infernal. She is a goddess, but one not
yet disimprisoned; one still half-imprisoned,&mdash;the articulate,
lovely still encased in the inarticulate, chaotic. How true! And does
she not propound her riddles to us? Of each man she asks daily, in mild
voice, yet with a terrible significance, &lsquo;Knowest thou the
meaning of this Day? What thou canst do To-day, wisely attempt to
do.&rsquo; Nature, Universe, Destiny, Existence, howsoever we name this
grand unnameable Fact, in the midst of which we live and struggle, is
as a heavenly bride and conquest to the wise and brave, to them who can
discern her behests and do them; a destroying fiend to them who cannot.
Answer her riddle, it is well with thee. Answer it not, pass on
regarding it not, it will answer itself; the solution for thee is a
thing of teeth and claws; Nature to thee is a dumb lioness, deaf to thy
pleadings, fiercely devouring. Thou art not now her victorious
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb176" href="#v1pb176" name=
"v1pb176">176</a>]</span>bridegroom; thou art her mangled victim,
scattered on the precipices, as a slave found treacherous, recreant,
ought to be, and must.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4052src" href=
"#xd20e4052" name="xd20e4052src">6</a></p>
<p>On the verge of the Desert, Prime Minister to the Necropolis at
whose gateway it stands, the Sphinx reposes amid the silence of science
and the centuries. Who built it? None can answer, so far as the human
artist, or the king under whom he worked, is concerned. But the ideas
and natural forces which built the Sphinx surround even now the
arch&aelig;ologist who tries to discover its history and chronology. As
fittest appendage to Carlyle&rsquo;s interpretation, let us read some
passages from Lepsius.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Oedipus for this king of the Sphinxes is yet wanting.
Whoever would drain the immeasurable sand-flood which buries the tombs
themselves, and lay open the base of the Sphinx, the ancient
temple-path, and the surrounding hills, could easily decide it. But
with the enigmas of history there are joined many riddles and wonders
of nature, which I must not leave quite unnoticed. The newest of all,
at least, I must describe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had descended with Abeken into a mummy-pit, to open some
newly discovered sarcophagi, and was not a little astonished, upon
descending, to find myself in a regular snow-drift of locusts, which,
almost darkening the heavens, flew over our heads from the south-west
from the desert in hundreds of thousands to the valley. I took it for a
single flight, and called my companions from the tombs, where they were
busy, that they might see this Egyptian wonder ere it was over. But the
flight continued; indeed the work-people said it had begun an hour
before. Then we first observed that the whole region, near and far, was
covered with locusts. I sent an attendant into the desert to discover
the breadth of the flock. He ran <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb177"
href="#v1pb177" name="v1pb177">177</a>]</span>for the distance of a
quarter of an hour, then returned and told us that, as far as he could
see, there was no end to them. I rode home in the midst of the locust
shower. At the edge of the fruitful plain they fell down in showers;
and so it went on the whole day until the evening, and so the next day
from morning till evening, and the third; in short to the sixth day,
indeed in weaker flights much longer. Yesterday it did seem that a
storm of rain in the desert had knocked down and destroyed the last of
them. The Arabs are now lighting great smoke-fires in the fields, and
clattering and making loud noises all day long to preserve their crops
from the unexpected invasion. It will, however, do little good. Like a
new animated vegetation, these millions of winged spoilers cover even
the neighbouring sand-hills, so that scarcely anything is to be seen of
the ground; and when they rise from one place they immediately fall
down somewhere in the neighbourhood; they are tired with their long
journey, and seem to have lost all fear of their natural enemies, men,
animals, smoke, and noise, in their furious wish to fill their
stomachs, and in the feeding of their immense number. The most
wonderful thing, in my estimation, is their flight over the naked
wilderness, and the instinct which has guided them from some oasis over
the inhospitable desert to the fat soil of the Nile vale. Fourteen
years ago, it seems, this Egyptian plague last visited Egypt with the
same force. The popular idea is that they are sent by the comet which
we have observed for twelve days in the South-west, and which, as it is
now no longer obscured by the rays of the moon, stretches forth its
stately tail across the heavens in the hours of the night. The Zodiacal
light, too, so seldom seen in the north, has lately been visible for
several nights in succession.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Other plagues of Egypt are described by Lepsius:&mdash; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb178" href="#v1pb178" name=
"v1pb178">178</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Suddenly the storm grew to a tremendous hurricane, such as I
have never seen in Europe, and hail fell upon us in such masses as
almost to turn day into night.... Our tents lie in a valley, whither
the plateau of the pyramids inclines, and are sheltered from the worst
winds from the north and west. Presently I saw a dashing mountain flood
hurrying down upon our prostrate and sand-covered tents, like a giant
serpent upon its certain prey. The principal stream rolled on to the
great tent; another arm threatened mine without reaching it. But
everything that had been washed from our tents by the shower was torn
away by the two streams, which joined behind the tents, and carried
into a pool behind the Sphinx, where a great lake immediately formed,
which fortunately had no outlet. Just picture this scene to yourself!
Our tents, dashed down by the storm and heavy rain, lying between two
mountain torrents, thrusting themselves in several places to the depth
of six feet in the sand, and depositing our books, drawings, sketches,
shirts, and instruments&mdash;yes, even our levers and iron crow-bars;
in short, everything they could seize, in the dark foaming mud-ocean.
Besides this, ourselves wet to the skin, without hats, fastening up the
weightier things, rushing after the lighter ones, wading into the lake
to the waist to fish out what the sand had not yet swallowed; and all
this was the work of a quarter of an hour, at the end of which the sun
shone radiantly again, and announced the end of this flood by a bright
and glorious rainbow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now comes the plague of mice, with which we were not formerly
acquainted; in my tent they grow, play, and whistle, as if they had
been at home here all their lives, and quite regardless of my presence.
At night they have already run across my bed and face, and yesterday I
started terrified from my slumbers, as I suddenly felt the sharp tooth
of such a daring guest at my foot. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb179" href="#v1pb179" name="v1pb179">179</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Above me a canopy of gauze is spread, in order to keep off
the flies, these most shameless of the plagues of Egypt, during the
day, and the mosquitos at night.... Scorpions and serpents have not
bitten us yet, but there are very malicious wasps, which have often
stung us.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The dale (in the Desert) was wild and monotonous, nothing but
sandstone rock, the surfaces of which were burned as black as coals,
but turned into burning golden yellow at every crack, and every ravine,
whence a number of sand-rivulets, like fire-streams from black dross,
ran and filled the valleys. No tree, no tuft of grass had we yet seen,
also no animals, except a few vultures and crows feeding on the carcase
of the latest fallen camel.... Over a wild and broken path, and cutting
stones, we came deeper and deeper into the gorge. The first wide basins
were empty, we therefore left the camels and donkeys behind, climbed up
the smooth granite wall, and thus proceeded amidst these grand rocks
from one basin to another; they were all empty. Behind there, in the
farthest ravine, the guide said there must be water, for it was never
empty; but there proved to be not a single drop. We were obliged to
return dry.... We saw the most beautiful <i>mirages</i> very early in
the day; they most minutely resemble seas and lakes, in which
mountains, rocks, and everything in their vicinity, are reflected as in
the clearest water. They form a remarkable contrast with the staring
dry desert, and have probably deceived many a poor wanderer, as the
legend goes. If one be not aware that no water is there, it is quite
impossible to distinguish the appearance from the reality. A few days
ago I felt quite sure that I perceived an overflowing of the Nile, or a
branch near El Mech&ecirc;ref, and rode towards it, but only found Bahr
Sheitan, Satan&rsquo;s water, as the Arabs call it.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e4079src" href="#xd20e4079" name="xd20e4079src">7</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb180" href="#v1pb180" name=
"v1pb180">180</a>]</span></p>
<p>Amid such scenery the Sphinx arose. Egypt was able to recognise the
problem of blended barrenness and beauty&mdash;alternation of
Nature&rsquo;s flowing breast and leonine claw&mdash;but could she
return the right answer? The primitive Egyptian answer may, indeed, as
I have guessed, be the great monuments of her civilisation, but her
historic solution has been another world. This world a desert, with
here and there a momentary oasis, where man may dance and feast a
little, stimulated by the corpse borne round the banquet, ere he passes
to paradise. So thought they and were deceived; from generation to
generation have they been destroyed, even unto this day. How destroyed,
Lepsius may again be our witness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The She&icirc;kh of the Saad&icirc;ch-derwishes rides to the
chief She&icirc;kh of all the derwishes of Egypt, El Bekri. On the way
thither, a great number of these holy folk, and others, too, who fancy
themselves not a whit behind-hand in piety, throw themselves flat on
the ground, with their faces downward, and so that the feet of one lie
close to the head of the next; over this living carpet the she&icirc;kh
rides on his horse, which is led on each side by an attendant, in order
to compel the animal to the unnatural march. Each body receives two
treads of the horse; most of them jump up again without hurt, but
whoever suffers serious, or as it occasionally happens, mortal injury,
has the additional ignominy to bear of not having pronounced, or not
being able to pronounce, the proper prayers and magical charms that
alone could save him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a fearful barbarous worship&rsquo; (the Sikr, in which
the derwishes dance until exhausted, howling &lsquo;No God but
Allah&rsquo;) &lsquo;which the astounded multitude, great and small,
gentle and simple, gaze upon seriously, and with stupid respect, and in
which it not unfrequently takes a part! The invoked deity is manifestly
much less an object of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb181" href=
"#v1pb181" name="v1pb181">181</a>]</span>reverence than the fanatic
saints who invoke him; for mad, idiotic, or other
psychologically-diseased persons are very generally looked upon as holy
by the Mohammedans, and treated with great respect. It is the
demoniacal, incomprehensibly-acting, and therefore fearfully-observed,
power of nature that the natural man always reveres when he perceives
it, because he is sensible of some connection between it and his
intellectual power, without being able to command it; first in the
mighty elements, then in the wondrous but obscure law-governed
instincts of animals, and at last in the yet more overpowering
ecstatical or generally abnormal mental condition of his own
race.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The right answer to the enigma of the Sphinx is Man. But this
creature prostrating himself under the She&icirc;kh&rsquo;s horse, or
under the invisible She&icirc;kh called Allah, and ascribing sanctity
to the half-witted, is not Man at all. Those hard-worked slaves who
escaped into the wilderness, and set up for worship an anthropomorphic
Supreme Will, and sought their promised milk and honey in this world
alone, carried with them the only force that could rightly answer the
Sphinx. <i>Their</i> Allah or Elohim they heard say,&mdash;&lsquo;Why
howlest thou to me? Go forward.&rsquo; Somewhat more significant than
his usual jests was that cartoon of <i>Punch</i> which represented the
Sphinx with relaxed face smiling recognition on the most eminent of
contemporary Israelites returning to the land of his race&rsquo;s
ancient bondage, to buy the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal half answers the
Sphinx; when man has subdued the Great Desert to a sea, the solution
will be complete, and the Sphinx may cast herself into it.</p>
<p>Far and wide through the Southern world have swarmed the locusts
described by Lepsius, and with them have migrated many superstitions.
The writer of this well remembers the visit of the so-called
&lsquo;Seventeen-year locusts,&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb182" href="#v1pb182" name="v1pb182">182</a>]</span>to the region
of Virginia where he was born, and across many years can hear the
terrible never-ceasing roar coming up from the woods, uttering, as all
agreed, the ominous word &lsquo;Pharaoh.&rsquo; On each wing every eye
could see the letter W, signifying War. With that modern bit of ancient
Egypt in my memory, I find the old Locust-mythology sufficiently
impressive.</p>
<p>By an old tradition the Egyptians, as described by Lepsius,
connected the locusts with the comet. In the Apocalypse (ix.) a falling
star is the token of the descent of the Locust-demon to unlock the pit
that his swarms may issue forth for their work of destruction. Their
king Abaddon, in Greek Apollyon,&mdash;Destroyer,&mdash;has had an
evolution from being the angel of the two (rabbinical) divisions of
Hades to the successive Chiefs of Saracenic hordes. It is interesting
to compare the graphic description of a locust-storm in Joel, with its
adaptation to an army of human destroyers in the Apocalypse. And again
the curious description of these hosts of Abaddon in the latter book,
partly repeat the strange notions of the Bedouins concerning the
locust,&mdash;one of whom, says Niebuhr, &lsquo;compared the head of
the locust to that of the horse; its breast to that of a lion; its feet
to those of a camel; its body to that of the serpent; its tail to that
of the scorpion; its horns (antenn&aelig;) to the locks of hair of a
virgin.&rsquo; The present generation has little reason to deny the
appropriateness of the biblical descriptions of Scythian hordes as
locusts. &lsquo;The land is as the garden of Eden before them, and
behind them a desolate wilderness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The ancient seeming contest between apparent Good and Evil in Egypt,
was represented in the wars of Ra and Set. It is said (Gen. iv. 26),
&lsquo;And to Seth, to him also was born a son; and he called his name
Enos; then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.&rsquo; Aquila
reads <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb183" href="#v1pb183" name=
"v1pb183">183</a>]</span>this&mdash;&lsquo;Then Seth began to be called
by the name of the Lord.&rsquo; Mr. Baring-Gould remarks on this that
Seth was at first regarded by the Egyptians as the deity of light and
civilisation, but that they afterwards identified as Typhon, because he
was the chief god of the Hyksos or shepherd kings; and in their hatred
of these oppressors the name of Seth was everywhere obliterated from
their monuments, and he was represented as an ass, or with an
ass&rsquo;s head.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4110src" href="#xd20e4110"
name="xd20e4110src">8</a> But the earliest date assigned to the Hyksos
dominion in Egypt, <span class="sc">B.C.</span> 2000, coincides with
that of the Egyptian planisphere in Kircher,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e4116src" href="#xd20e4116" name="xd20e4116src">9</a> where Seth
is found identified with Sirius, or the dog-headed Mercury, in
Capricorn. This is the Sothiac Period, or Cycle of the Dog-star. He was
thus associated with the goat and the winter solstice, to which
(<span class="sc">B.C.</span> 2000) Capricorn was adjacent. That Seth
or Set became the name for the demon of disorder and violence among the
Egyptians is, indeed, probably due to his being a chief god, among some
tribes Baal himself, among the Asiatics, before the time of the Hyksos.
It was already an old story to put their neighbours&rsquo; Light for
their own Darkness. The Ass&rsquo;s ears they gave him referred not to
his stupidity, but to his hearing everything, as in the case of the Ass
of Apuleius, and the ass Nicon of Plutarch, or, indeed, the many
examples of the same kind which preceeded the appearance of this much
misunderstood animal as the steed of Christ&rsquo;s triumphal entry
into Jerusalem. In Egyptian symbolism those long ears were as much
dreaded as devils&rsquo; horns. From the eyes of Ra all beneficent
things, from the eyes of Set all noxious things, were produced.
Amen-Ra, as the former was called, slew the son of Set, the great
serpent Naka, which in one hymn is perhaps tauntingly said to have
&lsquo;saved his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb184" href="#v1pb184"
name="v1pb184">184</a>]</span><i>feet</i>.&rsquo; Amen-Ra becomes Horus
and Set becomes Typhon. The Typhonian myth is very complex, and
includes the conflict between the Nile and all its enemies&mdash;the
crocodiles that lurk in it, the sea that swallows it, the drouth that
dries it, the burning heat that brings malaria from it, the floods that
render it destructive&mdash;and Set was through it evolved to a point
where he became identified with Saturn, Sheitan, or Satan. Plutarch,
identifying Set with Typho, says that those powers of the universal
Soul, which are subject to the influences of passions, and in the
material system whatever is noxious, as bad air, irregular seasons,
eclipses of the sun and moon, are ascribed to Typho. The name Set,
according to him, means &lsquo;violent&rsquo; and
&lsquo;hostile;&rsquo; and he was described as
&lsquo;double-headed,&rsquo; &lsquo;he who has two countenances,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;the Lord of the World.&rsquo; Not the least significant
fact, in a moral sense, is that Set or Typho is represented as the
brother of Osiris whom he slew.</p>
<p>Without here going into the question of relationship between Typhaon
and Typhoeus, we may feel tolerably certain that the fire-breathing
hurricane-monster Typhaon of Homer, and the hundred-headed, fierce-eyed
roarer Typhoeus&mdash;son of Tartarus, father of Winds and
Harpies&mdash;represent the same ferocities of Nature. No fitter place
was ever assigned him than the African desert, and the story of the
gods and goddesses fleeing before Typhon into Egypt, and there
transforming themselves into animals, from terror, is a transparent
tribute to the dominion over the wilderness of sand exercised by the
typhoon in its many moods. The vulture-harpy tearing the dead is his
child. He is many-headed; now hot, stifling, tainted; now tempestuous;
here sciroc, there hurricane, and often tornado. It may be indeed that
as at once coiled in the whirlwind and blistering, he is the fiery
serpent to appease <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb185" href=
"#v1pb185" name="v1pb185">185</a>]</span>whom Moses lifted the brasen
serpent for the worship of Israel. I have often seen snakes hung up by
negroes in Virginia, to bring rain in time of drouth. Typhon, as may
easily be seen by the accompanying figure (<a href="#v1fig14">14</a>),
is a hungry and thirsty demon. His tongue is lolling out with
thirst.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4134src" href="#xd20e4134" name=
"xd20e4134src">10</a> His later connection with the underworld is shown
in various myths, one of which seems to suggest a popular belief that
Typhon is not pleased with the mummies withheld from him, and that he
can enjoy his human viands only through burials of the dead. In Egypt,
after the Coptic Easter Monday&mdash;called Shemmen-Nesseem (smelling
the zephyr)&mdash;come the fifty-days&rsquo; hot wind, called Khamseen
or Cain wind. After slaying Abel, Cain wandered amid such a wind,
tortured with fever and thirst. Then he saw two birds fight in the air;
one having killed the other scratched a hole in the desert sand and
buried it. Cain then did the like by his brother&rsquo;s body, when a
zephyr sprang up and cooled his fever. But still, say the Alexandrians,
the fifty-days&rsquo; hot Cain wind return annually.</p>

<p>In pictures of the mirage, or in cloud-shapes faintly illumined by
the afterglow, the dwellers beside the plains of sand saw, as in
phantasmagoria, the gorgeous palaces, the air-castles, and mysterious
cities, which make the romance of the desert. Unwilling to believe that
such realms of barrenness had ever been created by any good
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb186" href="#v1pb186" name=
"v1pb186">186</a>]</span>god, they beheld in dreams, which answer to
nature&rsquo;s own mirage-dreaming, visions of dynasties passed away,
of magnificent palaces and monarchs on whose pomp and heaven-defying
pride the fatal sand-storm had fallen, and buried their glories in the
dust for ever. The desert became the emblem of immeasurable
all-devouring Time. In many of these legends there are intimations of a
belief that Eden itself lay where now all is unbroken desert. In the
beautiful legend in the Midrash of Solomon&rsquo;s voyage on the Wind,
the monarch alighted near a lofty palace of gold, &lsquo;and the scent
there was like the scent of the garden of Eden.&rsquo; The dust had so
surrounded this palace that Solomon and his companions only learned
that there had been an entrance from an eagle in it thirteen centuries
old, which had heard from its father the tradition of an entrance on
the western side. The obedient Wind having cleared away the sand, a
door was found on whose lock was written, &lsquo;Be it known to you, ye
sons of men, that we dwelt in this palace in prosperity and delight
many years. When the famine came upon us we ground pearls in the mill
instead of wheat, but it profited us nothing.&rsquo; Amid marvellous
splendours, from chamber to chamber garnished with ruby, topaz,
emerald, Solomon passed to a mansion on whose three gates were written
admonitions of the transitory nature of all things but&mdash;Death.
&lsquo;Let not fortune deceive thee.&rsquo; &lsquo;The world is given
from one to another.&rsquo; On the third gate was written, &lsquo;Take
provision for thy journey, and make ready food for thyself while it is
yet day; for thou shalt not be left on the earth, and thou knowest not
the day of thy Death.&rsquo; This gate Solomon opened and saw within a
life-like image seated: as the monarch approached, this image cried
with a loud voice, &lsquo;Come hither, ye children of Satan; see! King
Solomon is come to destroy you.&rsquo; Then fire <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb187" href="#v1pb187" name=
"v1pb187">187</a>]</span>and smoke issued from the nostrils of the
image; and there were loud and bitter cries, with earthquake and
thunder. But Solomon uttered against them the Ineffable Name, and all
the images fell on their faces, and the sons of Satan fled and cast
themselves into the sea, that they might not fall into the hands of
Solomon. The king then took from the neck of the image a silver tablet,
with an inscription which he could not read, until the Almighty sent a
youth to assist him. It said:&mdash;&lsquo;I, Sheddad, son of Ad,
reigned over a thousand thousand provinces, and rode on a thousand
thousand horses; a thousand thousand kings were subject to me, and a
thousand thousand warriors I slew<span class="corr" id="xd20e4154"
title="Not in source">.</span> Yet in the hour that the Angel of Death
came against me, I could not withstand him. Whoso shall read this
writing let him not trouble himself greatly about this world, for the
end of all men is to die, and nothing remains to man but a good
name.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4157src" href="#xd20e4157"

<p>Azazel&mdash;&lsquo;<span class="corr" id="xd20e4162" title=
"Source: strong against God">of doubtful meaning</span>&rsquo;&mdash;is
the biblical name of the Demon of the Desert (Lev. xvi.). &lsquo;Aaron
shall cast lots upon the two goats: one lot for Jehovah, and the other
for Azazel. And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the lot for
Jehovah fell, and offer him for a sin-offering: But the goat, on which
the lot for Azazel fell, shall be presented alive before Jehovah, to
make an atonement with him, to let him go to Azazel in the
wilderness.... And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the
live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of
Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them
upon the head of the goat, and send him away by the hand of a fit man
into the desert. And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities
unto <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb188" href="#v1pb188" name=
"v1pb188">188</a>]</span>a land not inhabited; and he shall let go the
goat in the desert.&rsquo; Of the moral elements here involved much
will have to be said hereafter. This demon ultimately turned to a
devil; and persisting through both forms is the familiar principle that
it is &lsquo;well enough to have friends on both sides&rsquo; so
plainly at work in the levitical custom; but it is particularly
interesting to observe that the same animal should be used as offerings
to the antagonistic deities. In Egyptian Mythology we find that the
goat had precisely this two-fold consecration. It was sacred to Chem,
the Egyptian Pan, god of orchards and of all fruitful lands; and it
became also sacred to Mendes, the &lsquo;Destroyer,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Avenging Power&rsquo; of Ra. It will thus be seen that the same
principle which from the sun detached the fructifying from the
desert-making power, and made Typhon and Osiris hostile brothers,
prevailed to send the same animal to Azazel in the Desert and Jehovah
of the milk and honey land. Originally the goat was supreme. The
Samaritan Pentateuch<span class="corr" id="xd20e4170" title=
"Not in source">, according to Aben Ezra (Preface to Esther),</span>
opens, &lsquo;In the beginning <span class="corr" id="xd20e4173" title=
"Source: the Goat">Ashima</span> created the heaven and the
earth.&rsquo; In the Hebrew culture-myth of Cain and Abel, also
brothers, there may be represented, as Goldziher supposes, the victory
of the agriculturist over the nomad or shepherd; but there is also
traceable in it the supremacy of the Goat, Mendez or Azima. &lsquo;Abel
brought the firstling of the goats.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Very striking is the American (Iroquois) myth of the conflict
between Joskeha and Tawiscara,&mdash;the White One and the Dark One.
They were twins, born of a virgin who died in giving them life. Their
grandmother was the moon (Ataensic, <i>she who bathes</i>). These
brothers fought, Joskeha using as weapon the horns of a stag, Tawiscara
the wild-rose. The latter fled sorely wounded, and the blood gushing
from him turned to flint-stones. The victor, who used the stag-horns
(the same weapon that Frey uses <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb189"
href="#v1pb189" name="v1pb189">189</a>]</span>against Beli, in the
Prose Edda, and denoting perhaps a primitive bone-age art), destroyed a
monster frog which swallowed all the waters, and guided the torrents
into smooth streams and lakes. He stocked the woods with game, invented
fire, watched and watered crops, and without him, says the old
missionary Brebeuf, &lsquo;they think they could not boil a pot.&rsquo;
The use by the desert-demon Tawiscara of a wild rose as his weapon is a
beautiful touch in this myth. So much loveliness grew even amid the
hard flints. One is reminded of the closing scene in the second part of
Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i>. There, when Faust has realised the perfect
hour to which he can say, &lsquo;Stay, thou art fair!&rsquo; by causing
by his labour a wilderness to blossom as a rose, he lies down in happy
death; and when the demons come for his soul, angels pelt them with
roses, which sting them like flames. Not wild roses were these, such as
gave the Dark One such poor succour. The defence of Faust is the roses
he has evoked from briars. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb190" href=

<p class="first">Related to the demons of Barrenness, and to the
hostile human demons, but still possessing characteristics of their
own, are the demons supposed to haunt gorges, mountain ranges, ridges
of rocks, streams which cannot be forded and are yet unbridged, rocks
that wreck the raft or boat. Each and every obstruction that stood in
the way of man&rsquo;s plough, or of his first frail ship, or his
migration, has been assigned its demon. The reader of Goethe&rsquo;s
page has only to turn to the opening lines of Walpurgisnacht in
<i>Faust</i> to behold the real pandemonium of the Northern man, as in
Milton he may find that of the dweller amid fiery deserts and
volcanoes. That labyrinth of vales, crossed with wild crag and furious
torrent, is the natural scenery to surround the orgies of the phantoms
which flit from the uncultured brain to uncultured nature. Elsewhere in
Goethe&rsquo;s great poem, Mephistopheles pits against the philosophers
the popular theory of the rugged remnants of chaos in nature, and the
obstacles before which man is powerless. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">Ruskin has the same gloomy report to make of the
mountaineers of Europe. &lsquo;The wild goats that leap along those
rocks have as much passion of joy in all that fair work of God as the
men that toil among them. Perhaps more.&rsquo; &lsquo;Is it not strange
to reflect that hardly an evening passes in London or Paris but one of
those cottages is painted for the better amusement of the fair and
idle, and shaded with pasteboard pines by the scene-shifter; and that
good and kind people,&mdash;poetically minded,&mdash;delight themselves
in imagining the happy life led by peasants who dwell by Alpine
fountains, and kneel to crosses upon peaks of rock? that nightly we lay
down our gold to fashion forth simulacra of peasants, in gay ribbons
and white bodices, singing sweet songs and bowing gracefully to the
picturesque crosses; and all the while the veritable peasants are
kneeling, songlessly, to veritable crosses in another temper than the
kind and fair audiences dream of, and assuredly with another kind of
answer than is got out of the opera catastrophe.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e4311src" href="#xd20e4311" name=
"xd20e4311src">3</a></p>
<p>The writer remembers well the emphasis with which a poor woman at
whose cottage he asked the path to the Natural Bridge in Virginia said,
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know why so many people come to these rocks; for
my part, give me a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb193" href=
"#v1pb193" name="v1pb193">193</a>]</span>level country.&rsquo; Many
ages lay between that aged crone and Emerson or Ruskin, and they were
ages of heavy war with the fortresses of nature. The fabled ordeals of
water and fire through which the human race passed were associated with
Ararat and Sinai, because to migrating or farming man the mountain was
always an ordeal, irrespective even of its torrents or its occasional
lava-streams. A terrible vista is opened by the cry of Lot, &lsquo;I
cannot escape to the mountain lest some evil take me!&rsquo; Not even
the fire consuming Sodom in the plains could nerve him to dare cope
with the demons of the steep places. As time went on, devotees proved
to the awe-stricken peasantries their sanctity and authority by
combating those mountain demons, and erecting their altars in the
&lsquo;high places.&rsquo; So many summits became sacred. But this very
sanctity was the means of bringing on successive demoniac hordes to
haunt them; for every new religion saw in those altars in &lsquo;high
places&rsquo; not victories over demons, but demon-shrines. And thus
mountains became the very battlefields between rival deities, each
demon to his or her rival; and the conflict lasts from the cursing of
the &lsquo;high places&rsquo; by the priests of Israel<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e4318src" href="#xd20e4318" name="xd20e4318src">4</a>
to the Devil&rsquo;s Pulpits of the Alps and Apennines. Among the
beautiful frescoes at Baden is that of the Angel&rsquo;s and the
Devil&rsquo;s Pulpit, by G&ouml;tzenberger. Near Gernsbach,
appropriately at the point where the cultivable valley meets the
unconquerable crests of rock, stand the two pulpits from which Satan
and an Angel contended, when the first Christian missionaries had
failed to convert the rude foresters. When, by the Angel&rsquo;s
eloquence, all were won from the Devil&rsquo;s side except a few
witches and usurers, the fiend tore up great masses of rock and built
the &lsquo;Devil&rsquo;s Mill&rsquo; on the mountain-top; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb194" href="#v1pb194" name=
"v1pb194">194</a>]</span>and he was hurled down by the Almighty on the
rocks near &lsquo;Lord&rsquo;s Meadow,&rsquo; where the marks of his
claws may still be seen, and where, by a diminishing number of
undiminished ears, his groans are still heard when a storm rages
through the valley.</p>
<p>Such conflicts as these have been in some degree associated with
every mountain of holy or unholy fame. Each was in its time a prosaic
Hill Difficulty, with lions by no means chained, to affright the hearts
of Mistrust and Timorous, till Dervish or Christian impressed there his
holy footprint, visible from Adam&rsquo;s Peak to Olivet, or built
there his convents, discernible from Meru and Olympus to Pontyprydd and
St. Catharine&rsquo;s Hill. By necessary truces the demons and deities
repair gradually to their respective summits,&mdash;Seir and Sinai hold
each their own. But the Holy Hills have never equalled the number of
Dark Mountains<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4326src" href="#xd20e4326"
name="xd20e4326src">5</a> dreaded by man. These obstructive demons made
the mountains Moul-ge and Nin-ge, names for the King and Queen of the
Accadian Hell; they made the Finnish Mount Kippumaki the abode of all
Pests. They have identified their name (Elf) with the Alps, given
nearly every tarn an evil fame, and indeed created a special class of
demons, &lsquo;Montagnards,&rsquo; much dreaded by medi&aelig;val
miners, whose faces they sometimes twisted so that they must look
backward physically, as they were much in the habit of doing mentally,
for ever afterward. Gervais of Tilbury, in his Chronicle, declares that
on the top of Mount Canigon in France, which has a very inaccessible
summit, there is a black lake of unknown depth, at whose bottom the
demons have a palace, and that if any one drops a stone into that
water, the wrath of the mountain demons is shown in sudden and
frightful tempests. From a like tarn in Cornwall, as Cornish Folklore
claims, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb195" href="#v1pb195" name=
"v1pb195">195</a>]</span>on an accessible but very tedious hill, came
up the hand which received the brand Escalibore when its master could
wield it no more,&mdash;as told in the Morte D&rsquo;Arthur, with,
however, clear reference to the sea.</p>
<p>I cannot forbear enlivening my page with the following sketch of a
visit of English officers to the realm of Ten-jo, the long-nosed
Mountain-demon of Japan, which is very suggestive of the mental
atmosphere amid which such spectres exist. The mountains and forests of
Japan are, say these writers, inhabited as thickly by good and evil
spirits as the Hartz and Black Forest, and chief among them, in
horrible sanctity, is O-yama,&mdash;the word echoes the Hindu Yama,
Japanese Amma, kings of Hades,&mdash;whose demon is Ten-jo.
&lsquo;Abdul and Mulney once started, on three days&rsquo; leave, with
the intention of climbing to the summit&mdash;not of Ten-jo&rsquo;s
nose, but of the mountain; their principal reason for so doing being
simply that they were told by every one that they had better not. They
first tried the ascent on the most accessible side, but fierce
two-sworded yakomins jealously guarded it; and they were obliged to
make the attempt on the other, which was almost inaccessible, and was
Ten-jo&rsquo;s region. The villagers at the base of the mountain begged
them to give up the project; and one old man, a species of patriarch,
reasoned with them. &lsquo;What are you going to do when you get to the
top?&rsquo; he asked. Our two friends were forced to admit that their
course, then, would be very similar to that of the king of France and
his men&mdash;come down again.</p>
<p>The old man laughed pityingly, and said, &lsquo;Well, go if you
like; but, take my word for it, Ten-jo will do you an
injury.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They asked who Ten-jo was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why Ten-jo,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;is an evil
spirit, with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb196" href="#v1pb196"
name="v1pb196">196</a>]</span>a long nose, who will dislocate your
limbs if you persist in going up the mountain on this side.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you know he has got a long nose?&rsquo; they asked,
&lsquo;Have you ever seen him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because all evil spirits have long noses&rsquo;&mdash;here
Mulney hung his head,&mdash;&lsquo;and,&rsquo; continued the old man,
not noticing how dreadfully personal he was becoming to one of the
party, &lsquo;Ten-jo has the longest of the lot. Did you ever know a
man with a long nose who was good?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come on,&rsquo; said Mulney hurriedly to Abdul, &lsquo;or the
old fool will make me out an evil spirit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Syonara,&rsquo; said the old man as they walked away,
&lsquo;but look out for Ten-jo!&rsquo;</p>
<p>After climbing hard for some hours, and not meeting a single human
being,&mdash;not even the wood-cutter could be tempted by the fine
timber to encroach on Ten-jo&rsquo;s precincts,&mdash;they reached the
top, and enjoyed a magnificent view. After a rest they started on their
descent, the worst part of which they had accomplished, when, as they
were walking quietly along a good path, Abdul&rsquo;s ankle turned
under him, and he went down as if he had been shot, with his leg broken
in two places. With difficulty Mulney managed to get him to the village
they had started from, and the news ran like wild-fire that Ten-jo had
broken the leg of one of the adventurous tojins.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told you how it would be,&rsquo; exclaimed the old man,
&lsquo;but you would go. Ah, Ten-jo is a dreadful fellow!&rsquo;</p>
<p>All the villagers, clustering round, took up the cry, and shook
their heads. Ten-jo&rsquo;s reputation had increased wonderfully by
this accident. Poor Abdul was on his back for eleven weeks, and numbers
of Japanese&mdash;for he was a general favourite amongst
them&mdash;went to see him, and to express their regret and horror at
Ten-jo&rsquo;s behaviour.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4358src" href=
"#xd20e4358" name="xd20e4358src">6</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>It is obvious that to a demon dwelling in a high mountain a long
nose would be variously useful to poke into the affairs of people
dwelling in the plains, and also to enjoy the scent of their sacrifices
offered at a respectful distance. That feature of the face which
Napoleon I. regarded as of martial importance, and which is prominent
in the warriors marked on the Mycen&aelig; pottery, has generally been
a physiognomical characteristic of European ogres, who are
blood-smellers. That the significance of Ten-jo&rsquo;s long nose is
this, appears probable when we compare him with the Calmuck demon
Erlik, whose long nose is for smelling out the dying. The Cossacks
believed that the protector of the earth was a many-headed elephant.
The snouted demon (<a href="#v1fig15">figure 15</a>) is from a picture
of Christ delivering Adam and Eve from hell, by Lucas Van Leyden,
1521.</p>

<p>The Chinese Mountains also have their demons. The demon of the
mountain T&rsquo;ai-shan, in Shantung, is believed to regulate the
punishments of men in this world and the next. Four other demon princes
rule over the principal mountain chains of the Empire. Mr. Dennys
remarks that mountainous localities are so regularly the homes of
fairies in Chinese superstition that some connection between the fact
and the relation of &lsquo;Elf&rsquo; to &lsquo;Alp&rsquo; in Europe
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb198" href="#v1pb198" name=

"xd20e4378src" href="#xd20e4378" name="xd20e4378src">7</a> But this
coincidence is by no means so remarkable as the appearance among these
Chinese mountain sprites of the magical &lsquo;Sesame,&rsquo; so
familiar to us in Arabian legend. The celebrated mountain Ku&rsquo;en
Lun (usually identified with the Hindoo Kush) is said to be peopled
with fairies, who cultivate upon its terraces the &lsquo;fields of
sesamum and gardens of coriander seeds,&rsquo; which are eaten as
ordinary food by those who possess the gift of longevity.</p>
<p>In the superstitions of the American Aborigines we find gigantic
demons who with their hands piled up mountain-chains as their castles,
from whose peak-towers they hurled stones on their enemies in the
plains, and slung them to the four corners of the earth.<a class=

Such was the terrible Apocatequil, whose statue was erected on the
mountains, with that of his mother on the one hand and his brother on
the other. He was Prince of Evil and the chief god of the Peruvians.
From Quito to Cuzco every Indian would give all he possessed to
conciliate him. Five priests, two stewards, and a crowd of slaves
served his image. His principal temple was surrounded by a considerable
village, whose inhabitants had no other occupation than to wait on
him.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4392src" href="#xd20e4392" name=

<p>The plaudits which welcomed the first railway train that sped
beneath the Alps, echoing amid their crags and gorges, struck with
death the old phantasms which had so long held sway in the imagination
of the Southern peasantry. The great tunnel was hewn straight through
the stony hearts of giants whom Christianity had tried to slay, and,
failing that, baptised and adopted. It is in the Tyrol <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb199" href="#v1pb199" name=
"v1pb199">199</a>]</span>that we find the clearest survivals of the old
demons of obstruction, the mountain monarchs. Such is Jordan the Giant
of Kohlh&uuml;tte chasm, near Ungarkopf, whose story, along with
others, is so prettily told by the Countess Von Gunther. This giant is
something of a Ten-jo as to nose, for he smells &lsquo;human
meat&rsquo; where his pursued victims are hidden, and his snort makes
things tremble as before a tempest; but he has not the intelligence
ascribed to large noses, for the boys ultimately persuade him that the
way to cross a stream is to tie a stone around his neck, and he is
drowned. One of the giants of Albach could carry a rock weighing 10,000
pounds, and his comrades, while carrying others of 700 pounds, could
leap from stone to stone across rivers, and stoop to catch the trout
with their hands as they leaped. The ferocious Orco, the mountain-ghost
who never ages, fulfils the tradition of his classic name by often
appearing as a monstrous black dog, from whose side stones rebound, and
fills the air with a bad smell (like Mephisto). His employment is
hurling wayfarers down precipices. In her story of the
&lsquo;Unholdenhof&rsquo;&mdash;or &lsquo;monster farm&rsquo; in the
Stubeithal&mdash;the Countess Von Gunther describes the natural
character of the mountain demons.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was on this self-same spot that the forester and his son
took up their abode, and they became the dread and abomination of the
whole surrounding country, for they practised, partly openly and partly
in secret, the most manifold iniquities, so that their nature and
bearing grew into something demoniacal. As quarrellers very strong, and
as enemies dreadfully revengeful, they showed their diabolical nature
by the most inhuman deeds, which brought down injury not only on those
against whom their wrath was directed, but also upon their families for
centuries. In the heights of the mountains they turned the beds of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb200" href="#v1pb200" name=
"v1pb200">200</a>]</span>torrents, and devastated by this means the
most flourishing tracts of land; on other places the Unholde set on
fire whole mountain forests, to allow free room for the avalanches to
rush down and overwhelm the farms. Through certain means they cut holes
and fissures in the rocks, in which, during the summer, quantities of
water collected, which froze in the winter, and then in the spring the
thawing ice split the rocks, which then rolled down into the valleys,
destroying everything before them.... But at last Heaven&rsquo;s
vengeance reached them. An earthquake threw the forester&rsquo;s house
into ruins, wild torrents tore over it, and thunderbolts set all around
it in a blaze; and by fire and water, with which they had sinned,
father and son perished, and were condemned to everlasting torments. Up
to the present day they are to be seen at nightfall on the mountain in
the form of two fiery boars.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4403src"
href="#xd20e4403" name="xd20e4403src">10</a></p>
<p>Some of these giants, as has been intimated, were converted. Such
was the case with Heimo, who owned and devastated a vast tract of
country on the river Inn, which, however, he bridged&mdash;whence
Innsbruck&mdash;when he became a christian and a monk. This conversion
was a terrible disappointment to the devil, who sent a huge dragon to
stop the building of the monastery; but Heimo attacked the dragon,
killed him, and cut out his tongue. With this tongue, a yard and a half
long, in his hand, he is represented in his statue, and the tongue is
still preserved in the cloister. Heimo became a monk at Wilten, lived a
pious life, and on his death was buried near the monastery. The stone
coffin in which the gigantic bones repose is shown there, and measures
over twenty-eight feet.</p>
<p>Of nearly the same character as the Mountain Demons, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb201" href="#v1pb201" name=
"v1pb201">201</a>]</span>and possessing even more features of the
Demons of Barrenness, are the monsters guarding rocky passes. They are
distributed through land, sea, and rivers. The famous rocks between
Italy and Sicily bore the names of dangerous monsters, Scylla and
Charybdis, which have now become proverbial expressions for alternative
perils besetting any enterprise. According to Homer, Scylla was a kind
of canine monster with six long necks, the mouths paved each with three
rows of sharp teeth; while Charybdis, sitting under her fig-tree, daily
swallowed the waters and vomited them up again.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e4412src" href="#xd20e4412" name="xd20e4412src">11</a> Distantly
related to these fabulous monsters, probably, are many of the old
notions of ordeals undergone between rocks standing close together, or
sometimes through holes in rocks, of which examples are found in Great
Britain. An ordeal of this kind exists at Pera, where the holy well is
reached through a narrow slit. Visitors going there recently on New
Year&rsquo;s Day were warned by the dervish in charge&mdash;&lsquo;Look
through it at the water if you please, but do not essay to enter unless
your consciences are completely free from sin, for as sure as you try
to pass through with a taint upon your soul, you will be gripped by the
rock and held there for ever.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=

&lsquo;<span lang="it">Bocca della Verit&agrave;</span>&rsquo;&mdash;a
great stone face like a huge millstone&mdash;stands in the portico of
the church S. Maria in Cosmedin at Rome, and its legend is that a
suspected person was required to place his hand through the open mouth;
if he swore falsely it would bite off the hand&mdash;the explanation
now given being that a swordsman was concealed behind to make good the
judicial shrewdness of the stone in case the oath were displeasing to
the authorities.</p>
<p>The myth of Scylla, which relates that she was a beautiful maiden,
beloved by Glaucus, whom Circe through <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb202" href="#v1pb202" name="v1pb202">202</a>]</span>jealousy
transformed to a monster by throwing magic herbs into the well where
she was wont to bathe, is recalled by various European legends. In
Thuringia, on the road to Oberhof, stands the Red Stone, with its
rosebush, and a stream issuing from beneath it, where a beautiful maid
is imprisoned. Every seven years she may be seen bathing in the stream.
On one occasion a peasant passing by heard a sneeze in the rock, and
called out, &lsquo;God help thee!&rsquo; The sneeze and the benediction
were repeated, until at the seventh time the man cried, &lsquo;Oh, thou
cursed witch, deceive not honest people!&rsquo; As he then walked off,
a wailing voice came out of the stone, &lsquo;Oh, hadst thou but only
wished the last time that God would help me<span class="corr" id=
"xd20e4428" title="Source: ,">.</span> He would have helped me, and
thou wouldst have delivered me; now I must tarry till the Day of
Judgment!&rsquo; The voice once cried out to a wedding procession
passing by the stone, &lsquo;To-day wed, next year dead;&rsquo; and the
bride having died a year after, wedding processions dread the spot.</p>
<p>The legends of giants and giantesses, so numerous in Great Britain,
are equally associated with rocky mountain-passes, or the boulders they
were supposed to have tossed thence when sportively stoning each other.
They are the Tor of the South and Ben of the North. The hills of
Ross-shire in Scotland are mythological monuments of
<i>Cailliachmore,</i> great woman, who, while carrying a pannier filled
with earth and stones on her back, paused for a moment on a level spot,
now the site of Ben-Vaishard, when the bottom of the pannier gave way,
forming the hills. The recurrence of the names Gog and Magog in
Scotland suggests that in mountainous regions the demons were
especially derived from the hordes of robbers and savages, among whom,
in their uncultivable hills, the ploughshare could never conquer the
spear and club. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb203" href="#v1pb203"
name="v1pb203">203</a>]</span>Richard Doyle enriched the first
Exhibition of the Grosvenor Gallery in London, 1877, with many
beautiful pictures inspired by European Folklore. They were a pretty
garniture for the cemetery of dead religions. The witch once seen on
her broom departing from the high crags of Cuhillan, cheered by her
faithful dwarf, is no longer unlovely as in the days when she was
burned by proxy in some poor human hag; obedient to art&mdash;a more
potent wand than her own&mdash;she reascends to the clouds from which
she was borne, and is hardly distinguishable from them. Slowly man came
to learn with the poet&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">It was the mountain streams that fed</p>
<p class="line">The fair green plain&rsquo;s amenities.<a class=

<p class="first">Then the giants became fairies, and not a few of these
wore at last the mantles of saints. A similar process has been
undergone by another subject, which finds its pretty epitaph in the
artist&rsquo;s treatment. We saw in two pictures the Dame Blanche of
Normandy, lurking in the ravine beside a stream under the dusk,
awaiting yon rustic wood-cutter who is presently horizontal in the air
in that mad dance, after which he will be found exhausted. As her
mountain-sister is faintly shaped out of the clouds that cap Cuhillan,
this one is an imaginative outgrowth of the twilight shadows, the
silvery glintings of moving clouds mirrored in pools, and her tresses
are long luxuriant grasses. She is of a sisterhood which passes by
hardly perceptible gradations into others, elsewhere
described&mdash;the creations of Illusion and Night. She is not
altogether one of these, however, but a type of more direct
danger&mdash;the peril of fords, torrents, thickets, marshes, and
treacherous pools, which may seem shallow, but are deep.</p>
<p>The water-demons have been already described in their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb204" href="#v1pb204" name=
"v1pb204">204</a>]</span>obvious aspects, but it is necessary to
mention here the simple obstructive river-demons haunting fords and
burns, and hating bridges. Many tragedies, and many personifications of
the forces which caused them, preceded the sanctity of the title
<i>Pontifex</i>. The torrent that roared across man&rsquo;s path seemed
the vomit of a demon: the sacred power was he who could bridge it. In
one of the most beautiful celebrations of Indra it is said: &lsquo;He
tranquillised this great river so that it might be crossed; he conveyed
across it in safety the sages who had been unable to pass over it, and
who, having crossed, proceeded to realise the wealth they sought; in
the exhilaration of the <i>soma,</i> Indra has done these
deeds.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4459src" href="#xd20e4459"
name="xd20e4459src">14</a> In Ceylon, the demon Tota still casts
malignant spells about fords and ferries.</p>
<p>Many are the legends of the opposition offered by demons to
bridge-building, and of the sacrifices which had to be made to them
before such works could be accomplished. A few specimens must suffice
us. Mr. Dennys relates a very interesting one of the &lsquo;Loh-family
bridge&rsquo; at Shanghai. Difficulty having been found in laying the
foundations, the builder vowed to Heaven two thousand children if the
stones could be placed properly. The goddess addressed said she would
not require their lives, but that the number named would be attacked by
small-pox, which took place, and half the number died. A Chinese author
says, &lsquo;If bridges are not placed in proper positions, such as the
laws of geomancy indicate, they may endanger the lives of thousands, by
bringing about a visitation of small-pox or sore eyes.&rsquo; At
Hang-Chow a tea-merchant cast himself into the river Tsien-tang as a
sacrifice to the Spirit of the dikes, which were constantly being
washed away.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Devil&rsquo;s Bridges,&rsquo; to which Mephistopheles
alludes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb205" href="#v1pb205" name=
"v1pb205">205</a>]</span>so proudly, are frequent in Germany, and most
of them, whether natural or artificial, have diabolical associations.
The oldest structures often have legends in which are reflected the
conditions exacted by evil powers, of those who spanned the fords in
which men had often been drowned. Of this class is the Montafon Bridge
in the Tyrol, and another is the bridge at Ratisbon. The legend of the
latter is a fair specimen of those which generally haunt these ancient
structures. Its architect was apprentice to a master who was building
the cathedral, and laid a wager that he would bridge the Danube before
the other laid the coping-stone of the sacred edifice. But the work of
bridging the river was hard, and after repeated failures the apprentice
began to swear, and wished the devil had charge of the business!
Whereupon he of the cloven foot appeared in guise of a friar, and
agreed to build the fifteen arches&mdash;for a consideration. The fee
was to be the first three that crossed the bridge. The cunning
apprentice contrived that these three should not be human, but a dog, a
cock, and a hen. The devil, in wrath at the fraud, tore the animals to
pieces and disappeared; a procession of monks passed over the bridge
and made it safe; and thereon are carved figures of the three animals.
In most of the stories it is a goat which is sent over and mangled,
that poor animal having preserved its character as scape-goat in a
great deal of the Folklore of Christendom. The Danube was of old
regarded as under the special guardianship of the Prince of Darkness,
who used to make great efforts to obstruct the Crusaders voyaging down
it to rescue the Holy Land from pagans. On one occasion, near the
confluence of the Vilz and Danube, he began hurling huge rocks into the
river-bed from the cliffs; the holy warriors resisted successfully by
signing the cross and singing an anthem, but the huge stone first
thrown caused a whirl <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb206" href=
"#v1pb206" name="v1pb206">206</a>]</span>and swell in that part of the
river, which were very dangerous until it was removed by engineers.</p>
<p>It is obvious, especially to the English, who have so long found a
defensive advantage in the silver streak of sea that separates them
from the Continent, that an obstacle, whether of mountain-range or sea,
would, at a certain point in the formation of a nation, become as
valuable as at another it might be obstructive. Euphemism is credited
with having given the friendly name &lsquo;Euxine&rsquo; to the rough
&lsquo;Axine&rsquo; Sea,&mdash;&lsquo;terrible to foreigners.&rsquo;
But this is not so certain. Many a tribe has found the Black Sea a
protection and a friend. In the case of mountains, their protective
advantages would account at once for Milton&rsquo;s celebration of
Freedom as a mountain nymph, and for the stupidity of the people that
dwell amid them, so often remarked; the very means of their
independence would also be the cause of their insulation and barbarity.
It is for those who go to and fro that knowledge is increased. The
curious and inquiring are most apt to migrate; the enterprising will
not submit to be shut away behind rocks and mountains; by their
departure there would be instituted, behind the barriers of rock and
hill, a survival of the stupidest. These might ultimately come to
worship their chains and cover their craggy prison-walls with convents
and crosses. The demons of aliens would be their gods. The climbing
Hannibals would be their devils. It might have been expected, after the
passages quoted from Mr. Ruskin concerning the bovine condition of
Alpine peasantries, that he would salute the tunnel through Mont Cenis.
The peasantries who would see in the sub-alpine engine a demon are
extinct. Admiration of the genii of obstruction, and horror of the
demons that vanquished them, are discoverable only in folk-tales
distant enough to be pretty, such as the interesting Serbian story of
&lsquo;Satan&rsquo;s jugglings <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb207"
href="#v1pb207" name="v1pb207">207</a>]</span>and God&rsquo;s
might,&rsquo; in which fairies hiding in successively opened nuts
vainly try to oppose with fire and flood a she-demon pursuing a prince
and his bride, to whose aid at last comes a flash of lightning which
strikes the fiend dead.</p>
<p>One of the beautiful &lsquo;<span lang="fr">Contes d&rsquo;une
Grand&rsquo;m&egrave;re</span>,&rsquo; by George Sand, <i lang="fr">Le
g&eacute;ant Y&eacute;ous</i>, has in it the sense of many fables born
of man&rsquo;s struggle with obstructive nature. With her wonted
felicity she places the scene of this true human drama near the
mountain Y&eacute;ous, in the Pyrenees, whose name is a far-off echo of
Zeus. The summit bore an enormous rock which, seen from a distance,
appeared somewhat like a statue. The peasant Miquelon, who had his
little farm at the mountain&rsquo;s base, whenever he passed made the
sign of the cross and taught his little son Miquel to do the same,
telling him that the great form was that of a pagan god, an enemy of
the human race. An avalanche fell upon the home and garden of Miquelon;
the poor man himself was disabled for life, his house and farm turned
in a moment into a wild mass of stones. Miquel looked up to the summit
of Y&eacute;ous; the giant had disappeared; henceforth it was the
mighty form of an organic monster which the boy saw stretched over what
had once been their happy home and smiling acres. The family went about
begging, Miquelon repeating his strange appeal, &lsquo;<span lang=
"fr">Le g&eacute;ant s&rsquo;est couch&eacute; sur moi.</span>&rsquo;
But when at last the old man dies, the son resolves to fulfil the
silent dream of his life; he will encounter the giant Y&eacute;ous
still in possession of his paternal acres. With eyes of the young world
this boy sees starting up here and there amid the vast debris, the head
of the demon he wishes to crush. He hurls stones hither and thither
where some fearful feature or limb appears. He is filled with rage; his
dreams are filled with attacks on the giant, in which the colossal head
tumbles only to reappear on the shoulders; every broken limb has the
self-repairing power. There is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb208"
href="#v1pb208" name="v1pb208">208</a>]</span>no progress. But as the
boy grows, and the contest grows, and need comes, there gathers in
Miquel a desire to clear the ground. When he begins to think, it is no
longer the passion to avenge his father on the stony giant which
possesses him, but to recover their lost garden. Thus, indeed, the
giant himself could alone be conquered. The huge rocks are split by
gunpowder, some fragments are made into fences, others into a
comfortable mansion for Miquel&rsquo;s mother and sisters. When the
garden smiles again, and all are happy the demon form is no longer
discoverable.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4487src" href="#xd20e4487"
name="xd20e4487src">15</a></p>
<p>This little tale interprets with fine insight the demonology of
barrenness and obstruction. The boy&rsquo;s wrath against the
unconscious cause of his troubles is the rage often observed in
children who retaliate upon the table or chair on which they have been
bruised, and it repeats embryologically the rage of the world&rsquo;s
boyhood inspired by ascription of personal motives to inanimate
obstructions. Possibly such wrath might have added something to the
force with which man entered upon his combat with nature; but George
Sand&rsquo;s tale reminds us that whatever was gained in force was lost
in its misdirection. Success came in the proportion that fury was
replaced by the youth&rsquo;s growing recognition that he was dealing
with facts that could not be raged out of existence. It is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb209" href="#v1pb209" name=
"v1pb209">209</a>]</span>crowned when he makes friends with the
unconquerable remnant of the giant, and sees that he is not altogether
evil.</p>
<p>It is at this stage that the higher Art, conversant with Beauty,
enters to relieve man of many moral wounds received in the struggle.
Clothed with moss and clematis, Y&eacute;ous appears not so hideous
after all. Further invested by the genius of a Turner, he would be
beautiful. Y&eacute;ous is a fair giant after all, only he needed
finish. He is a type of nature.</p>
<p>The boyhood of the world has not passed away with Miquel. We find a
fictitious dualism cherished by the lovers of nature in their belief or
feeling that nature exerts upon man some spiritual influence. Ruskin
has said that in looking from the Campanile at Venice to the circle of
snow which crowns the Adriatic, and then to the buildings which contain
the works of Titian and Tintoret, he has felt unable to answer the
question of his own heart, By which of these&mdash;the nature or the
manhood&mdash;has God given mightier evidence of Himself? So nature may
teach the already taught. While Ruskin looks from the Campanile, the
peasant is fighting the mountain and calling its rocky grandeurs by the
devil&rsquo;s name; before the pictures he kneels. Untaught by art and
science, the mind can derive no elevation from nature, can find no
sympathy in it. It is a false notion that there is any compensation for
the ignorant, denied access to art-galleries, in ability to pass their
Sundays amid natural scenery. Health that may bring them, but mentally
they are still inside the prison-walls from which look the stony eyes
of Fates and Furies. Natural sublimities cannot refine minds crude as
themselves; they must pass through thought before they can feed
thought; it is nature transfigured in art that changes the snow-clad
mountain from a heartless giant to a saviour in snow-pure raiment.

<p class="first">Most beautiful of all the goddesses of India is Maya,
Illusion. In Hindu iconography she is portrayed in drapery of beautiful
colours, with decoration of richest gems and broidery of flowers. From
above her crown falls a veil which, curving above her knees, returns on
the other side, making, as it were, also an apron in which are held
fair animal forms&mdash;prototypes of the creation over which she has
dominion. The youthful yet serious beauty of her face and head is
surrounded with a semi-aureole, fringed with soft lightning, striated
with luminous sparks; and these are background for a cruciform nimbus
made of three clusters of rays. Maya presses her full breasts, from
which flow fountains of milk which fall in graceful streams to mingle
with the sea on which she stands.</p>
<p>So to our Aryan ancestors appeared the spirit that paints the
universe, flushing with tints so strangely impartial fruits forbidden
and unforbidden for man and beast. Mankind are slandered by the
priest&rsquo;s creed, <i lang="la">Populus vult decipi;</i> they are
justly vindicated in Plato&rsquo;s aphorism, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb211" href="#v1pb211" name=
"v1pb211">211</a>]</span>&lsquo;Unwillingly is the soul deprived of
truth;&rsquo; but still they are deceived. Large numbers are truly
described by Swedenborg, who found hells whose occupants believed
themselves in heaven and sang praises therefor. Such praises we may
hear in the loud laughter proceeding from dens where paradise has been
gained by the cheap charm of a glass of gin or a prostitute&rsquo;s
caress. Serpent finds its ideal in serpent. In heaven, says Swedenborg,
we shall see things as they are. But it is the adage of those who have
lost their paradise, and eat still the dry dust of reality not raised
by science; the general world has not felt that divine curse, or it has
been wiped away so that the most sensual fool may rejoice in feeling
himself God&rsquo;s darling, and pities the paganism of Plato. Man and
beast are certain that they do see things as they are. Maya&rsquo;s
milk is tinctured from the poppies of her robe; untold millions of
misgivings have been put to sleep by her tender bounty; the waters that
sustain her are those of Lethe.</p>
<p>But beneath every illusive heaven Nature stretches also an illusive
hell. The poppies lose their force at last, and under the scourge of
necessity man wakes to find all his paradise of roses turned to briars.
Maya&rsquo;s breast-fountains pass deeper than the surface&mdash;from
one flows soft Lethe, the other issues at last in Phlegethon. Fear is
even a more potent painter than Hope, and out of the manifold menaces
of Nature can at last overlay the fairest illusions. It is a pathetic
fact, that so soon as man begins to think his first theory infers a
will at work wherever he sees no cause; his second, to suppose that it
will harm him!</p>
<p>Harriet Martineau&rsquo;s account of her childish terror caused by
seeing some prismatic colours dancing on the wall of a vacant room she
was entering&mdash;&lsquo;imps&rsquo; that had no worse origin than a
tremulous candelabrum, but which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb212"
href="#v1pb212" name="v1pb212">212</a>]</span>haunted her nerves
through life&mdash;is an experience which may be traced in the haunted
childhood of every nation. There are other phenomena besides these
prismatic colours, which have had an evil name in popular superstition,
despite their beauty. Strange it might seem to a Buddhist that yon
exquisite tree with its blood-red buds should be called the Judas-tree,
as to us that the graceful swan which might be the natural emblem of
purity should be associated with witchcraft! But the student of
mythology will at every moment be impressed by the fact that myths
oftener represent a primitive science than mere fancies and conceits.
The sinuous neck of the swan, its passionate jealousy, and the uncanny
whistle, or else dumbness, found where, from so snowy an outside,
melody might have been looked for, may have made this animal the type
of a double nature. The treacherous brilliants of the serpent, or honey
protected by stings, or the bright blossoms of poisons, would have
trained the instinct which apprehends evil under the apparition of
beauty. This, as we shall have occasion to see, has had a controlling
influence upon the ethical constitution of our nature. But it is at
present necessary to observe that the primitive science generally
reversed the induction of our later philosophy; for where an evil or
pain was discovered in anything, it concluded that such was its
<i lang="fr">raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i>, and its attractive
qualities were simply a demon&rsquo;s treacherous bait. However, here
are the first stimulants to self-control in the lessons that taught
distrust of appearances.</p>
<p>Because many a pilgrim perished through a confidence in the
lake-pictures of the mirage which led to carelessness about economising
his skin of water, the mirage gained its present name&mdash;Bahr
Sheitan, or Devil&rsquo;s Water. The &lsquo;Will o&rsquo; wisp,&rsquo;
which appeared to promise the night-wanderer <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb213" href="#v1pb213" name=
"v1pb213">213</a>]</span>warmth or guidance, but led him into a bog,
had its excellent directions as to the place to avoid perverted by an
unhappy misunderstanding into a wilful falsehood, and has been branded
<i lang="la">ignis fatuus</i>. Most of the mimicries in nature
gradually became as suspicious to the primitive observer as
<i>aliases</i> to a magistrate. The thing that seemed to be fire, or
water, but was not; the insect or animal which took its hue or form
from some other, from the leaf-spotted or stem-striped cats to that
innocent insect whose vegetal disguise has gained for it the familiar
name of &lsquo;Devil&rsquo;s Walking-stick;&rsquo; the humanlike hiss,
laugh, or cry of animals; the vibratory sound or movement which so
often is felt as if near when it really is far; the sand which seems
hard but sinks; the sward which proves a bog;&mdash;all these have
their representation in the demonology of delusion. The Coroados of
Brazil says that the Evil One &lsquo;sometimes transforms (himself)
into a swamp, &amp;c., leads him astray, vexes him, brings him into
danger, and even kills him.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4546src"
href="#xd20e4546" name="xd20e4546src">1</a> It is like an echo of
Burton&rsquo;s account. &lsquo;Terrestrial devils are those lares,
genii, faunes, satyrs, wood-nymphs, foliots, fairies, Robin
Good-fellows, trulli, &amp;c., which, as they are most conversant with
men, so they do them most harm. These are they that dance on heaths and
greens, as Lavater thinks with Trithemius, and, as Olaus Magnus adds,
leave that green circle which we commonly find in plain fields. They
are sometimes seen by old women and children. Hieron. Pauli, in his
description of the city of Bercino, Spain, relates how they have been
familiarly seen near that town, about fountains and hills.
&lsquo;Sometimes,&rsquo; saith Trithemius, &lsquo;they lead simple
people into the recesses of mountains and show them wonderful
sights,&rsquo; &amp;c. Giraldus Cambrensis gives an instance of a monk
of Wales that was so deluded. Paracelsus reckons <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb214" href="#v1pb214" name=
"v1pb214">214</a>]</span>up many places in Germany where they do
usually walk about in little coats, some two feet long.<a class=

Real dangers beset the woods and mountain passes, the swamp and
quicksand; in such forms did they haunt the untamed jungles of
imagination!</p>
<p>Over that sea on which Maya stands extends the silvery wand of
Glamour. It descended to the immortal Old Man of the Sea, favourite of
the nymphs, oracle of the coasts, patron of fishermen, friend of
Proteus, who could see through all the sea&rsquo;s depths and assume
all shapes. How many witcheries could proceed from the many-tinted sea
to affect the eyes and enable them to see Triton with his wreathed
horn, and mermaids combing their hair, and marine monsters, and
Aphrodite poised on the white foam! Glaucoma it may be to the
physicians; but Glaucus it is in the scheme of Maya, who has never left
land or sea without her witness. Beside the Polar Sea a Samoyed sailor,
asked by Castr&eacute;n &lsquo;where is Num&rsquo; (<i>i.e.,</i>
Jumala, his god), pointed to the dark distant sea, and said, <i>He is
there</i>.</p>
<p>To the ancients there were two seas,&mdash;the azure above, and that
beneath. The imaginative child in its development passes all those
dreamy coasts; sees in clouds mountains of snow on the horizon, and in
the sunset luminous seas laving golden isles. When as yet to the young
world the shining sun was Berchta, the white fleecy clouds were her
swans. When she descended to the sea, as a thousand stories related, it
was to repeat the course of the sun for all tribes looking on a
westward sea. No one who has read that charming little book, &lsquo;The
Gods in Exile,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4565src" href=
"#xd20e4565" name="xd20e4565src">3</a> will wonder at the happy
instinct of learning shown in Heine&rsquo;s <span class=

<p class="first">This of course is Heinesque, and has no relation to
any legend of Bertha, but is a fair specimen of mythology in the
making, and is quite in the spirit of many of the myths that have
flitted around sunset on the sea. Whatever the explanation of their
descent, the Shining One and her fleecy retinue were transformed. When
to sea or lake came Berchta (or Perchta), it was as Bertha of the Large
Foot (<i>i.e.,</i> webbed), or of the Long Nose (beak), and her troop
were Swan-maidens. Their celestial character was changed with that of
their mistress. They became familiars of sorcerers and sorceresses. To
&lsquo;wear yellow slippers&rsquo; became the designation of a
witch.</p>
<p>How did these fleecy white cloud-phantoms become demonised? What
connection is there between them and the enticing Lorelei and the
dangerous Rhine-daughters watching over golden treasures, once,
perhaps, metaphors of moonlight ripples? They who have listened to the
wild laughter of these in Wagner&rsquo;s opera, <i lang="de">Das
Rheingold,</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb216" href="#v1pb216"
name="v1pb216">216</a>]</span>and their weird &lsquo;Heiayaheia!&rsquo;
can hardly fail to suspect that they became associated with the real
human nymphs whom the summer sun still finds freely sporting in the
bright streams of Russia, Hungary, Austria, and East Germany, naked and
not ashamed. Many a warning voice against these careless Phrynes, who
may have left tattered raiment on the shore to be transfigured in the
silvery waves, must have gone forth from priests and anxious mothers.
Nor would there be wanting traditions enough to impress such warnings.
Few regions have been without such stories as those which the traveller
Hiouen-Thsang (7th century) found in Buddhist chronicles of the
Rakshasis of Ceylon. &lsquo;They waylay the merchants who land in the
isle, and, changing themselves to women of great beauty, come before
them with fragrant flowers and music; attracting them with kind words
to the town of Iron, they offer them a feast, and give themselves up to
pleasure with them; then shut them in an iron prison, and eat them one
after the other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There is a strong accent of human nature in the usual plot of the
Swan-maiden legend, her garments stolen while she bathes, and her
willingness to pay wondrous prices for them&mdash;since they are her
feathers and her swanhood, without which she must remain for ever
captive of the thief. The stories are told in regions so widely
sundered, and their minor details are so different, that we may at any
rate be certain that they are not all traceable solely to fleecy
clouds. Sometimes the garments of the demoness&mdash;and these beings
are always feminine&mdash;are not feathery, as in the German stories,
but seal-skins, or of nondescript red tissue. Thus, the Envoy Li
Ting-yuan (1801) records a Chinese legend of a man named Ming-ling-tzu,
a poor and worthy farmer without family, who, on going to draw water
from a spring near his house, saw a woman bathing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb217" href="#v1pb217" name=
"v1pb217">217</a>]</span>in it. She had hung her clothes on a pine
tree, and, in punishment for her &lsquo;shameless ways&rsquo; and for
her fouling the well, he carried off the dress. The clothing was unlike
the familiar Lewchewan in style, and &lsquo;of a ruddy sunset
colour.&rsquo; The woman, having finished her bath, cried out in great
anger, &lsquo;What thief has been here in broad day? Bring back my
clothes, quick.&rsquo; She then perceived Ming-ling-tzu, and threw
herself on the ground before him. He began to scold her, and asked why
she came and fouled his water; to which she replied that both the pine
tree and the well were made by the Creator for the use of all. The
farmer entered into conversation with her, and pointed out that fate
evidently intended her to be his wife, as he absolutely refused to give
up her clothes, while without them she could not get away. The result
was that they were married. She lived with him for ten years, and bore
him a son and a daughter. At the end of that time her fate was
fulfilled: she ascended a tree during the absence of her husband, and
having bidden his children farewell, glided off on a cloud and
disappeared.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4627src" href="#xd20e4627"
name="xd20e4627src">5</a></p>
<p>In South Africa a parallel myth, in its demonological aspect, bears
no trace of a cloud origin. In this case a Hottentot, travelling with a
Bushwoman and her child, met a troop of wild horses. They were all
hungry; and the woman, taking off a petticoat made of human skin, was
instantly changed into a lioness. She struck down a horse, and lapped
its blood; then, at the request of the Hottentot, who in his terror had
climbed a tree, she resumed her petticoat and womanhood, and the
friends, after a meal of horseflesh, resumed their journey.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e4632src" href="#xd20e4632" name="xd20e4632src">6</a>
Among the Minussinian Tartars these demons partake of the nature of the
Greek Harpies; they are bloodthirsty vampyre-demons who drink the blood
of men slain in battle, darken <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb218"
href="#v1pb218" name="v1pb218">218</a>]</span>the air in their flight,
and house themselves in one great black fiend.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e4637src" href="#xd20e4637" name="xd20e4637src">7</a> As we go
East the portrait of the Swan-maiden becomes less dark, and she is not
associated with the sea or the under-world. Such is one among the
Malays, related by Mr. Tylor. In the island of Celebes it is said that
seven nymphs came down from the sky to bathe, and were seen by
Kasimbaha, who at first thought them white doves, but in the bath
perceived they were women. He stole the robe of one of them, Utahagi,
and as she could not fly without it, she became his wife and bare him a
son. She was called Utahagi because of a single magic white hair she
had; this her husband pulled out, when immediately a storm arose, and
she flew to heaven. The child was in great grief, and the husband cast
about how he should follow her up into the sky.</p>
<p>The Swan-maiden appears somewhat in the character of a Nemesis in a
Siberian myth told by Mr. Baring-Gould. A certain Samoyed who had
stolen a Swan-maiden&rsquo;s robe, refused to return it unless she
secured for him the heart of seven demon robbers, one of whom had
killed the Samoyed&rsquo;s mother. The robbers were in the habit of
hanging up their hearts on pegs in their tent. The Swan-maiden procured
them. The Samoyed smashed six of the hearts; made the seventh robber
resuscitate his mother, whose soul, kept in a purse, had only to be
shaken over the old woman&rsquo;s grave for that feat to be
accomplished, and the Swan-maiden got back her plumage and flew away
rejoicing.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4642src" href="#xd20e4642" name=
"xd20e4642src">8</a></p>
<p>In Slavonic Folklore the Swan-maiden is generally of a dangerous
character, and if a swan is killed they are careful not to show it to
children for fear they will die. When they appear as ducks, geese, and
other water-fowl, they are apt to be more mischievous than when they
come as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb219" href="#v1pb219" name=
"v1pb219">219</a>]</span>pigeons; and it is deemed perilous to kill a
pigeon, as among sailors it was once held to kill an albatross.
Afanasief relates a legend which shows that, even when associated with
the water-king, the Tsar Morskoi or Slavonic Neptune, the pigeon
preserves its beneficent character. A king out hunting lies down to
drink from a lake (as in the story related on p. 146), when Tsar
Morskoi seizes him by the beard, and will not release him until he
agrees to give him his infant son. The infant prince, deserted on the
edge of the fatal lake, by advice of a sorceress hides in some bushes,
whence he presently sees twelve pigeons arrive, which, having thrown
off their feathers, disport themselves in the lake. At length a
thirteenth, more beautiful than the rest, arrives, and her
<i>sorochka</i> (shift) Ivan seizes. To recover it she agrees to be his
wife, and, having told him he will find her beneath the waters, resumes
her pigeon-shape and flies away. Beneath the lake he finds a beautiful
realm, and though the Tsar Morskoi treats him roughly and imposes heavy
tasks on him, the pigeon-maiden (Vassilissa) assists him, and they
dwell together happily.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4652src" href=
"#xd20e4652" name="xd20e4652src">9</a></p>
<p>In Norse Mythology the vesture of the uncanny maid is oftenest a
seal-skin, and a vein of pathos enters the legends. Of the many legends
of this kind, still believed in Sweden and Norway, one has been
pleasantly versified by Miss Eliza Keary. A fisherman having found a
pretty white seal-skin, took it home with him. At night there was a
wailing at his door; the maid enters, becomes his wife, and bears him
three children. But after seven years she finds the skin, and with it
ran to the shore. The eldest child tells the story to the father on his
return home.</p>

</div>
<p class="first">Some of the legends of this character are nearly as
realistic as Mr. Swinburne&rsquo;s &lsquo;Morality&rsquo; of David and
Bathsheba. To imagine the scarcity of wives in regions to which the
primitive Aryan race migrated, we have only to remember the <i>ben
trovato</i> story of Californians holding a ball in honour of a bonnet,
in the days before women had followed them in migration. To steal
Bathsheba&rsquo;s clothes, and so capture her, might at one period have
been sufficiently common in Europe to require all the terrors contained
in the armoury of tradition concerning the demonesses that might so be
taken in, and might so tempt men to take them in. In the end they might
disappear, carrying off treasures in the most prosaic fashion, or
perhaps they might bring to one&rsquo;s doors a small Trojan war. It is
probable that the sentiment of modesty, so far as it is represented in
the shame of nudity, was the result of prudential agencies. Though the
dread of nudity has become in some regions a superstition in the female
mind strong enough to have its martyrs&mdash;as was seen at the sinking
of the <i>Northfleet</i> and the burning hotel in St. Louis&mdash;it is
one that has been fostered by men in distrust of their own animalism.
In barbarous regions, where civilisation introduces clothes, the women
are generally <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb221" href="#v1pb221"
name="v1pb221">221</a>]</span>the last to adopt them; and though Mr.
Herbert Spencer attributes this to female conservatism, it appears more
probable that it is because the men are the first to lose their
innocence and the women last to receive anything expensive. It is
noticeable how generally the Swan-maidens are said in the myths to be
captured by violence or stratagem. At the same time the most
unconscious temptress might be the means of breaking up homes and
misleading workmen, and thus become invested with all the wild legends
told of the illusory phenomena of nature in popular mythology.</p>
<p>It is marvellous to observe how all the insinuations of the bane
were followed by equal dexterities in the antedote. The fair tempters
might disguise their intent in an appeal to the wayfarer&rsquo;s
humanity; and, behold, there were a thousand well-attested narratives
ready for the lips of wife and mother showing the demoness appealing
for succour to be fatalest of all!</p>
<p>There is a stone on the M&uuml;ggelsberger, in Altmark, which is
said to cover a treasure; this stone is sometimes called
&lsquo;Devil&rsquo;s Altar,&rsquo; and sometimes it is said a fire is
seen there which disappears when approached. It lies on the verge of
Teufelsee,&mdash;a lake dark and small, and believed to be fathomless.
Where the stone lies a castle once stood which sank into the ground
with its fair princess. But from the underground castle there is a
subterranean avenue to a neighbouring hill, and from this hill of an
evening sometimes comes an old woman, bent over her staff. Next day
there will be seen a most beautiful lady combing her long golden hair.
To all who pass she makes her entreaties that they will set her free,
her pathetic appeals being backed by offer of a jewelled casket which
she holds. The only means of liberating her is, she announces, that
some one shall bear her on his shoulders three times round <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb222" href="#v1pb222" name=
"v1pb222">222</a>]</span>Teufelsee church without looking back. The
experiment has several times been made. One villager at his first round
saw a large hay-waggon drawn past him by four mice, and following it
with his eyes received blows on the ears. Another saw a waggon drawn by
four coal-black fire-breathing horses coming straight against him,
started back, and all disappeared with the cry &lsquo;Lost again for
ever!&rsquo; A third tried and almost got through. He was found
senseless, and on recovering related that when he took the princess on
his shoulders she was light as a feather, but she grew heavier and
heavier as he bore her round. Snakes, toads, and all horrible animals
with fiery eyes surrounded him; dwarfs hurled blocks of wood and stones
at him; yet he did not look back, and had nearly completed the third
round, when he saw his village burst into flames; then he looked
behind&mdash;a blow felled him&mdash;and he seems to have only lived
long enough to tell this story. The youth of K&ouml;pernick are warned
to steel their hearts against any fair maid combing her hair near
Teufelsee. But the folklore of the same neighbourhood admits that it is
by no means so dangerous for dames to listen to appeals of this kind.
In the Gohlitzsee, for example, a midwife was induced to plunge in
response to a call for aid; having aided a little Merwoman in travail,
she was given an apronful of dust, which appeared odd until on shore it
proved to be many thalers.</p>
<p>In countries where the popular imagination, instead of being
scientific, is trained to be religiously retrospective, it relapses at
the slightest touch into the infantine speculations of the human race.
Not long ago, standing at a shop-window in Ostend where a
&lsquo;Japanese Siren&rsquo; was on view, the clever imposture
interested me less than the comments of the passing and pausing
observers. The most frequent wonders seriously expressed were, whether
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb223" href="#v1pb223" name=
"v1pb223">223</a>]</span>she sang, or combed her hair, or was under a
doom, or had a soul to be saved. Every question related to Circe,
Ulysses and the Sirens, and other conceptions of antiquity. The
Japanese artists rightly concluded they could float their Siren in any
intellectual waters where Jonah in his whale could pass, or a fish
appear with its penny. Nay, even in their primitive form the Sirens
find their kith and kin still haunting all the coasts of northern
Europe. A type of the Irish and Scottish Siren may be found in the very
complete legend of one seen by John Reid, shipmaster of Cromarty. With
long flowing yellow hair she sat half on a rock, half in water, nude
and beautiful, half woman half fish, and John managed to catch and hold
her tight till she had promised to fulfil three wishes; then, released,
she sprang into the sea. The wishes were all fulfilled, and to one of
them (though John would never reveal it) the good-luck of the Reids was
for a century after ascribed.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4714src" href=
"#xd20e4714" name="xd20e4714src">10</a></p>
<p>The scene of this legend is the &lsquo;Dropping Cave,&rsquo; and
significantly near the Lover&rsquo;s Leap. One of John&rsquo;s wishes
included the success of his courtship. These Caves run parallel with
that of Venusberg, where the minstrel Tannh&auml;user is tempted by
Venus and her nymphs. Heine finishes off his description of this Frau
Venus by saying he fancied he met her one day in the Place
Br&eacute;da. &lsquo;What do you take this lady to be?&rsquo; asked he
of Balzac, who was with him. &lsquo;She is a mistress,&rsquo; replied
Balzac. &lsquo;A duchess rather,&rsquo; returned Heine. But the friends
found on further explanation that they were both quite right.
Venus&rsquo; doves, soiled for a time, were spiritualised at last and
made white, while the snowy swan grew darker. An old German word for
swan, <i>elbiz</i>, originally denoting its whiteness (<i>albus</i>),
furthered its connection with all &lsquo;elfish&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb224" href="#v1pb224" name=
"v1pb224">224</a>]</span>beings&mdash;<i>elf</i> being from the same
word, meaning white; but, as in Goethe&rsquo;s &lsquo;<span lang=
"de">Erl K&ouml;nig</span>,&rsquo; often disguising a dark character.
The Swan and the Pigeon meet (with some modifications) as symbols of
the Good and Evil powers in the legend of Lohengrin. The witch
transforms the boy into a Swan, which, however, draws to save his
sister, falsely accused of his murder, the Knight of the Sangreal, who,
when the mystery of his holy name is inquired into by his too curious
bride, is borne away by white doves. These legends all bear in them,
however faintly, the accent of the early conflict of religion with the
wild passions of mankind. Their religious bearings bring us to
inquiries which must be considered at a later phase of our work. But
apart from purely moral considerations, it is evident that there must
have been practical dangers surrounding the early social chaos amid
which the first immigrants in Europe found themselves.</p>
<p>Although the legend of Lady Godiva includes elements of another
origin, it is probable that in the fate of Peeping Tom there is a
distant reflection of the punishment sometimes said to overtake those
who gazed too curiously upon the Swan-maiden without her feathers. The
devotion of the nude lady of Coventry would not be out of keeping with
one class of these mermaiden myths. There is a superstition, now
particularly strong in Iceland, that all fairies are children of Eve,
whom she hid away on an occasion when the Lord came to visit her,
because they were not washed and presentable. So he condemned them to
be for ever invisible. This superstition seems to be related to an old
debate whether these pr&aelig;ternatural beings are the children of
Adam and Eve or not. A Scotch story bears against that conclusion. A
beautiful nymph, with a slight robe of green, came from the sea and
approached a fisherman while he was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb225" href="#v1pb225" name="v1pb225">225</a>]</span>reading his
Bible. She asked him if it contained any promise of mercy for her. He
replied that it contained an offer of salvation to &lsquo;all the
children of Adam;&rsquo; whereupon with a loud shriek she dashed into
the sea again. Euphemism would co-operate with natural compassion in
saying a good word for &lsquo;the good little people,&rsquo; whether
hiding in earth or sea. In Altmark, &lsquo;Will-o&rsquo;-wisps&rsquo;
are believed to be the souls of unbaptized children&mdash;sometimes of
lunatics&mdash;unable to rest in their graves; they are called
&lsquo;Light-men,&rsquo; and it is said that though they may sometimes
mislead they often guide rightly, especially if a small coin be thrown
them,&mdash;this being also an African plan of breaking a
sorcerer&rsquo;s spell. Christianity long after its advent in Germany
had to contend seriously with customs and beliefs found in some
lakeside villages where the fishermen regarded themselves as in
friendly relations with the pr&aelig;ternatural guardians of the
waters, and unto this day speak of their presiding sea-maiden as a Holy
Fr&auml;ulein. They hear her bells chiming up from the depths in holy
seasons to mingle with those whose sounds are wafted from church
towers; and it seems to have required many fables, told by prints of
fishermen found sitting lifeless on their boats while listening to
them, to gradually transfer reverence to the new christian fairy.</p>

<p class="first">The temptations of fishermen to secure objects seen at
the bottom of transparent lakes, sometimes appearing like boxes or
lumps of gold, and even more reflections of objects in the upper world
or air, must have been sources of danger; there are many tales of their
being so beguiled to destruction. These things were believed treasures
of the little folk who live under water, and would not part with them
except on payment. In Blumenthal lake, &lsquo;tis said, there is an
iron-bound yellow coffer which fishermen often have tried to raise, but
their cords are cut as it nears the surface. At the bottom of the same
lake valuable clothing is seen, and a woman who once tried to secure it
was so nearly drowned that it is thought safer to leave it. The legends
of sunken towns (as in Lake Paarsteinchen and Lough Neagh), and bells
(whose chimes may be heard on certain sacred days), are probably
variants of this class of delusions. They are often said to have been
sunk by some final vindictive stroke of a magician or witch resolved to
destroy the city no longer trusting them. Landslides, engulfing seaside
homes, might originate legends like that of King Gradlon&rsquo;s
daughter Dahut, whom the Breton peasant sees in rough weather on rocks
around Poul-Dahut, where she unlocked the sluice-gates on the city Is
in obedience to her fiend-lover.</p>
<p>If it be remembered that less than fifty years ago Dr.
Belon<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4919src" href="#xd20e4919" name=
"xd20e4919src">11</a> thought it desirable to anatomise gold fishes,
and prove in various ways that it is a fallacy to suppose they feed on
pure gold (as many a peasant near Lyons declares of the laurets sold
daily in the market), it will hardly be thought wonderful that perilous
visions of precious things were seen by early fishermen in pellucid
depths, and that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb229" href="#v1pb229"
name="v1pb229">229</a>]</span>these should at last be regarded as
seductive arts of Lorelei, who have given many lakes and rivers the
reputation of requiring one or more annual victims.</p>
<p>Possibly it was through accumulation of many dreams about beautiful
realms beneath the sea or above the clouds that suicide became among
the Norse folk so common. It was a proverb that the worst end was to
die in bed, and to die by suicide was to be like Egil, and Omund, and
King Hake, like nearly all the heroes who so passed to Valhalla. The
Northman had no doubt concerning the paradise to which he was going,
and did not wish to reach it enfeebled by age. But the time would come
when the earth and human affection must assert their claims, and the
watery tribes be pictured as cruel devourers of the living. Even so
would the wood-nymphs and mountain-nymphs be degraded, and fearful
legends of those lost and wandering in dark forests be repeated to
shuddering childhood. The actual dangers would mask themselves in the
endless disguises of illusion, the wold and wave be peopled with cruel
and treacherous seducers. Thus suicide might gradually lose its charms,
and a dismal underworld of heartless gnomes replace the grottoes and
fairies.</p>
<p>We may close this chapter with a Scottish legend relating to the
&lsquo;Shi&rsquo;ichs,&rsquo; or Men of Peace, in which there is a
strange intimation of a human mind dreaming that it dreams, and so far
on its way to waking. A woman was carried away by these shadowy beings
in order that she might suckle her child which they had previously
stolen. During her retention she once observed the Shi&rsquo;ichs
anointing their eyes from a caldron, and seizing an opportunity, she
managed to anoint one of her own eyes with the ointment. With that one
eye she now saw the secret abode and all in it &lsquo;as they really
were.&rsquo; The deceptive splendour <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb230" href="#v1pb230" name="v1pb230">230</a>]</span>had vanished.
The gaudy ornaments of a fairy grot had become the naked walls of a
gloomy cavern. When this woman had returned to live among human beings
again, her anointed eye saw much that others saw not; among other
things she once saw a &lsquo;man of peace,&rsquo; invisible to others,
and asked him about her child. Astonished at being recognised, he
demanded how she had been able to discover him; and when she had
confessed, he spit in her eye and extinguished it for ever.

<p class="first">From the little night which clings to man even by
day&mdash;his own shadow&mdash;to the world&rsquo;s great shade of
darkness, innumerable are the coverts from which have emerged the black
procession of phantoms which have haunted the slumbers of the world,
and betrayed the enterprise of man.</p>
<p>How strange to the first man seemed that shadow walking beside him,
from the time when he saw it as a ghost tracking its steps and giving
him his name for a ghost, on to the period in which it seemed the
emanation of an occult power, as to them who brought their sick into
the streets to be healed by the passing shadow of Peter; and still on
to the day when Beaumont wrote&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Our acts our angels are, or good or ill,</p>

</div>
<p class="first">or that in which Goethe found therein the mystical
symbol of the inward arrest of our moral development, and said
&lsquo;No man can jump off of his shadow.&rsquo; And then from the
culture of Europe we pass to the Feejee-Islanders, and find them
believing that every man has two spirits. One is his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb232" href="#v1pb232" name=
"v1pb232">232</a>]</span>shadow, which goes to Hades; the other is his
image as reflected in water, and it is supposed to stay near the place
where the man dies.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4956src" href=

Brocken, these demons of the Shadow are trembled at long after they are
known to be the tremblers themselves mirrored on air. Have we not
priests in England still fostering the belief that the baptized child
goes attended by a white spirit, the unbaptized by a dark one? Why then
need we apologise for the Fijians?</p>
<p>But little need be said here of demons of the Dark, for they are
closely related to the phantasms of Delusion, of Winter, and others
already described. Yet have they distinctive characters. As many as
were the sunbeams were the shadows; every goddess of the Dawn (Ushas)
cast her shadow; every Day was swallowed up by Night. This is the
cavern where hide the treacherous Panis (fog) in Vedic mythology, they
who steal and hide Indra&rsquo;s cows; this is the realm of Hades (the
invisible); this is the cavern of the hag Th&ouml;kk (dark) in
Scandinavian mythology,&mdash;she who alone of all in the universe
refused to weep for Baldur when he was shut up in Helheim, where he had
been sent by the dart of his blind brother H&ouml;dr (darkness). In the
cavern of Night sleep the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus, and Barbarossa,
and all slumbering phantoms whose genius is the night-winged raven.
Thorr, the Norse Hercules, once tried to lift a cat&mdash;as it seemed
to him&mdash;from the ground; but it was the great mid-earth serpent
which encircles the whole earth. Impossible feat as it was for
Thorr&mdash;who got only one paw of the seeming cat off the
ground&mdash;in that glassless and gasless era, invention has
accomplished much in that direction; but the black Cat is still
domiciled securely among idols of the mental cave.</p>
<p>There is an Anglo-Saxon word, <i>cof-godas</i> (lit. cove-gods),
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb233" href="#v1pb233" name=
"v1pb233">233</a>]</span>employed as the equivalent of the Latin
<i>lares</i> (the Penates, too, are interpreted as <i>cof-godu,
cofa</i> signifying the inner recess of a house, <i>penetrale</i>). The
word in German corresponding to this <i>cofa</i>, is <i>koben</i>; and
from this Hildebrand conjectures <i>kob-old</i> to be derived. The
latter part of the word he supposes to be walt (one who &lsquo;presides
over,&rsquo; <i>e.g.</i>, Walter); so that the original form would be
<i>kob-walt</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4993src" href="#xd20e4993"

among the least enlightened of its members&mdash;the menials, who still
often neutralise the efforts of rational people to dispel the delusions
of their children&mdash;the discredited deities and demons of the past
found refuge, and through a little baptismal change of names are
familiars of millions unto this day. In the words of the ancient
Hebrew, &lsquo;they lay in their own houses prisoners of darkness,
fettered with the bonds of a long night.&rsquo; &lsquo;No power of the

stolen away by Kobolds, and these &lsquo;worthless&rsquo; ores left in

<p class="first">It could only have been at a comparatively late period
of social development that Sancho&rsquo;s benediction on the inventor
of sleep could have found general response. The Red Indian found its
helplessness fatal when the &lsquo;Nick of the Woods&rsquo; was abroad;
the Scotch sailor found in it a demon&rsquo;s opiate when the
&lsquo;Nigg of the Sea&rsquo; was gathering his storms above the
sleeping watchman. It was among <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb235"

</div>
<p class="first">Besides this fact that the night befriends and masks
every treacherous foe, it is also to be remembered that man is weakest
at night. Not only is he weaker than by day in the veil drawn over his
senses, but physiologically also. When the body is wearied out by the
toils or combats of the day, and the mind haunted by dreams of danger,
there are present all the terrors which Byron portrays around the
restless pillow of Sardanapalus. The war-horse of the day becomes a
night-mare in the darkness. In the Heimskringla it is recorded:
&lsquo;Vanland, Svegdir&rsquo;s son, succeeded his father and ruled
over the Upsal domain. He was a great warrior, and went far around in
different lands. Once he took up his winter abode in Finland with Snio
the Old, and got his daughter Drisa in marriage; but in spring he set
out leaving Drisa behind, and although he had promised to return within
three years he did not come back for ten. Then Drisa sent a message to
the witch Hulda; and sent Visbur, her son by Vanland, to Sweden. Drisa
bribed the witch-wife Hulda, either that she should bewitch Vanland to
return to Finland or kill him. When this witch-work was going on
Vanland was at Upsal, and a great desire came over him to go to
Finland, but his friends and counsellors advised him against it, and
said the witchcraft of the Fin people showed itself in this desire of
his to go there. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb236" href=
"#v1pb236" name="v1pb236">236</a>]</span>then became very drowsy, and
laid himself down to sleep; but when he had slept but a little while he
cried out, saying, &lsquo;Mara was treading on him.&rsquo; His men
hastened to help him; but when they took hold of his head she trod on
his legs, and when they laid hold of his legs she pressed upon his
head; and it was his death.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5069src"
href="#xd20e5069" name="xd20e5069src">5</a></p>
<p>This witch is, no doubt, Hildur, a Walkyr of the Edda, leading
heroes to Walhalla. Indeed, in Westphalia, nightmare is called
Walriderske. It is a curious fact that &lsquo;Mara&rsquo; should be
preserved in the French word for nightmare, <i>Cauche-mar</i>,
&lsquo;cauche&rsquo; being from Latin <i lang="la">calcare,</i> to
tread. Through Teutonic folklore this Night-demon of many names, having
floated from England in a sieve paddled with cow-ribs, rides to the
distress of an increasingly unheroic part of the population. Nearly
always still the &lsquo;Mahrt&rsquo; is said to be a pretty
woman,&mdash;sometimes, indeed, a sweetheart is involuntarily
transformed to one,&mdash;every rustic settlement abounding with tales
of how the demoness has been captured by stopping the keyhole, calling
the ridden sleeper by his baptismal name, and making the sign of the
cross; by such process the wicked beauty appears in human form, and is
apt to marry the sleeper, with usually evil results. The fondness of
cats for getting on the breasts of sleepers, or near their breath, for
warmth, has made that animal a common form of the &lsquo;Mahrt.&rsquo;
Sometimes it is a black fly with red ring around its neck. This
demoness is believed to suffer more pain than it inflicts, and vainly
endeavours to destroy herself.</p>
<p>In savage and nomadic times sound sleep being an element of danger,
the security which required men to sleep on their arms demanded also
that they should sleep as it were with one eye open. Thus there might
have arisen both the intense vividness which demons acquired by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb237" href="#v1pb237" name=
"v1pb237">237</a>]</span>blending subjective and objective impressions,
and the curious inability, so frequent among barbarians and not unknown
among the men civilised, to distinguish dream from fact. The habit of
day-dreaming seems, indeed, more general than is usually supposed.
Dreams haunt all the region of our intellectual twilight,&mdash;the
borderland of mystery, where rise the sources of the occult and the
mystical which environ our lives. The daily terrors of barbarous life
avail to haunt the nerves of civilised people, now many generations
after they have passed away, with special and irrational shudders at
certain objects or noises: how then must they have haunted the dreams
of humanity when, like the daughter of Nathan the Wise, rescued from
flames, it passed the intervals of strife</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="line">And fire and flame in all she sees or fancies;</p>

</div>
<p class="first">Among the sources of demoniac beliefs few indeed are
more prolific than Dreams. &lsquo;The witchcraft of sleep,&rsquo; says
Emerson, &lsquo;divides with truth the empire of our lives. This soft
enchantress visits two children lying locked in each other&rsquo;s
arms, and carries them asunder by wide spans of land and sea, wide
intervals of time. &lsquo;Tis superfluous to think of the dreams of
multitudes; the astonishment remains that one should dream; that we
should resign so quietly this deifying reason and become the theatre of
delusions, shows, wherein time, space, persons, cities, animals, should
dance before us in merry and mad confusion, a delicate creation
outdoing the prime and flower of actual nature, antic comedy
alternating with horrid spectres. Or we seem busied for hours and days
in peregrinations over seas and lands, in earnest dialogues, strenuous
actions for nothings and absurdities, cheated by spectral jokes, and
waking suddenly with ghostly laughter, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb238" href="#v1pb238" name="v1pb238">238</a>]</span>to be rebuked
by the cold lonely silent midnight, and to rake with confusion in
memory among the gibbering nonsense to find the motive of this
contemptible cachinnation.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5095src"

<p>It has always been the worst of periods of religious excitement that
they shape the dreams of old and young, and find there a fearful and
distorted, but vivid and realistic, embodiment of their feverish
experiences. In the days of witchcraft thousands visited the
Witches&rsquo; Sabbaths, as they believed and danced in the Walpurgis
orgies, borne (by hereditary orthodox canon) on their own brooms up
their own chimneys; and to-day, by the same morbid imaginations, the
victims are able to see themselves or others elongated, levitated,
floating through the air. If people only knew how few are ever really
wide-awake, these spiritual nightmares would soon reach their
termination. The natural terrors before which helpless man once
cowered, have been prolonged past all his real victories over his
demons by a succession of such nightmares, so that the vulgar religion
might be portrayed somewhat as Richard Wagner described his first
tragedy, in which, having killed off forty-two of his characters, he
had to bring them back as ghosts to carry on the fifth act!</p>
<p>The perils of darkness, as ambush of foes human and animal,
concealer of pitfalls, misguider of footsteps, misdirector of aims,
were more real than men can well imagine in an age of gaslight plus the
policeman. The myth of Joshua commanding the sun to stand still; the
cry of Ajax when darkness fell on the combat, &lsquo;Grant me but to
see!&rsquo; refer us to the region from which come all childish
shudders at going into the dark. The limit of human courage is reached
where its foe is beyond the reach of its force. Fighting in the dark
may even be suicidal. A German <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb239"
href="#v1pb239" name="v1pb239">239</a>]</span>fable of blindfold
zeal&mdash;the awakened sleeper demolishing his furniture and knocking
out his own teeth in the attempt to punish cats&mdash;has its tragical
illustrations also. But none of these actual dangers have been of more
real evil to man than the demonisation of them. This rendered his very
skill a blunder, his energy weakness. If it was bad to retreat in the
dusk from an innocent bush into an unrecognised well, it was worse to
meet the ghost with rune or crucifix and find it an assassin. When man
fights with his shadow, he instantly makes it the demon he fears;
ghoul-like it preys upon his paralysed strength, vampyre-like it sucks
his blood, and he is consigned disarmed to the evil that is no shadow.
The Scottish Sinclair marching through Norway, in the 16th century,
owes his monument at Wiblungen rather to the magpie believed to precede
him as a spy, with night and day upon its wings, than to his own
prowess or power.</p>
<p>In a sense all demons, whatever their shapes, are the ancient brood
of night. Mental darkness, even more moral darkness within, supply the
phantasmagoria in which unknown things shape themselves as demons. Esau
is already reconciled, but guilty Jacob must still wrestle with him as
a phantom of Fear till daybreak. A work has already been written on
&lsquo;The Night-side of Nature,&rsquo; but it would require many
volumes to tell the story of what monsters have been conjured out of
the kind protecting darkness. How great is the darkness which man makes
for himself out of the imagination which should be his light and
vision! Much of the so-called &lsquo;religion&rsquo; of our time is but
elaborate demoniculture and artificial preservation of mental
Walpurgis-nights. Nott (Night) says the Edda rides first on her horse
called Hrimfaxi (frost-maned), which every morning as he ends his
course bedews the earth with the foam that falls from his bit. Though
the horse of Day&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb240" href=
"#v1pb240" name="v1pb240">240</a>]</span>Skinfaxi, or
Shining-mane&mdash;follows hard after her, yet the foam is by no means
drunk up by his fires. Foam of the old phantasms still lingers in our
medi&aelig;val liturgies, and even falls afresh where the daylight is
shut out that altar-candles may burn, or for other dark seances are
prepared the conditions necessary for whatsoever loves not the
light.</p>
<p>What we call the Dark Ages were indeed spiritually a perpetual
seance with lights lowered. Nay, human superstition was able to turn
the very moon and stars into mere bluish night-tapers, giving just
light enough to make the darkness visible in fantastic shapes
fluttering around the Prince of Darkness,&mdash;or Non-existence in
Chief! How much of the theosophic speculation of our time is the mere
artificial conservation of that darkness? How much that still flits
bat-winged from universities, will, in the future, be read with the
same wonder as that with which even the more respectable bats can now
read account of the midnight brood which now for the most part sleep
tranquilly in such books as Burton&rsquo;s &lsquo;Anatomy of
Melancholy&rsquo;? &lsquo;There are,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;certain
spirits which Miraldus calls Ambulones, that walk about midnight on
great heaths and desert places, which (saith Lavater) draw men out of
their way, and lead them all night by a byway, or quite bar them of
their way. These have several names in several places. We commonly call
them Pucks. In the deserts of Lop, in Asia, such illusions of walking
spirits are often perceived, as you may read in M. Paulus, the
Venetian, his travels. If one lose his company by chance, these devils
will call him by his name, and counterfeit voices of his companions to
seduce him. Lavater and Cicogna have a variety of examples of spirits
and walking devils in this kind. Sometimes they sit by the wayside to
give men falls, and make <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb241" href=
"#v1pb241" name="v1pb241">241</a>]</span>their horses stumble and start
as they ride (according to the narration of that holy man Ketellus in
Nubrigensis, that had an especial grace to see devils); and if a man
curse and spur his horse for stumbling, they do heartily rejoice at
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While observing a spirited and imaginative picture by Macallum of
the Siege of Jerusalem, it much interested me to observe the greater or
less ease with which other visitors discovered the portents in the air
which, following the narrative of Josephus, the artist had vaguely
portrayed. The chariots and horsemen said to have been seen before that
event were here faintly blent with indefinite outlines of clouds; and
while some of the artist&rsquo;s friends saw them with a distinctness
greater, perhaps, than that with which they impressed the eye of the
artist himself, others could hardly be made to see anything except
shapeless vapour, though of course they all agreed that they were there
and remarkably fine.</p>
<p>It would seem that thus, in a London studio, there were present all
the mental pigments for frescoing the air and sky with those visions of
a&euml;rial armies or huntsmen which have become so normal in history
as to be, in a subjective sense, natural. In the year 1763, an author,
styling himself Theophilus Insulanus, published at Edinburgh a book on
Second-Sight, in which he related more than a hundred instances of the
power he believed to exist of seeing events before they had occurred,
and whilst, of course, they did not exist. It is not difficult in
reading them to see that they are all substantially one and the same
story, and that the sight in operation was indeed second; for man or
woman, at once imaginative and illiterate, have a second and
supernumerary pair of eyes inherited from the traditional superstitions
and ghost stories which fill all the air they breathe from the cradle
to the grave. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb242" href="#v1pb242"
name="v1pb242">242</a>]</span>While the mind is in this condition, that
same nature whose apparitions and illusions originally evoked and
fostered the glamoury, still moves on with her minglings of light and
shade, cloud and mirage, giving no word of explanation. There are never
wanting the shadowy forms without that cast their shuttles to the dark
idols of the mental cave, together weaving subtle spells round the
half-waking mind.</p>
<p>In the year 1743 all the North of England and Scotland was in alarm
on account of some spectres which were seen on the mountain of Souter
Fell in Cumberland. The mountain is about half-a-mile high. On a summer
evening a farmer and his servant, looking from Wilton Hall, half a mile
off, saw the figures of a man and a dog pursuing some horses along the
mountain-side, which is very steep; and on the following morning they
repaired to the place, expecting to find dead bodies, but finding none.
About one year later a troop of horsemen were seen riding along the
same mountain-side by one of the same persons, the servant, who then
called others who also saw the <span class="corr" id="xd20e5121" title=
"Source: aerial">a&euml;rial</span> troopers. After a year had elapsed
the above vision was attested before a magistrate by two of those who
saw it. The event occurred on the eve of the Rebellion, when horsemen
were exercising, and when also the popular mind along the Border may be
supposed to have been in a highly excited condition.</p>
<p>What was seen on this strongly-authenticated occasion? Was anything
seen? None can tell. It is open to us to believe that there may have
been some play of mirage. As there are purely a&euml;rial echoes, so
are there a&euml;rial reflectors for the eye. On the other hand, the
vision so nearly resembles the spectral processions which have passed
through the mythology of the world, that we can never be sure that it
was not the troop of King Arthur, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb243" href="#v1pb243" name="v1pb243">243</a>]</span>emerging from
Avallon to announce the approaching strife. A few fleecy,
strangely-shaped clouds, chasing each other along the hillside in the
evening&rsquo;s dusk would have amply sufficed to create the latter
vision, and the danger of the time would easily have supplied all the
Second-Sight required to reveal it to considerable numbers. In
questions of this kind a very small circumstance&mdash;a phrase, a
name, perhaps&mdash;may turn the balance of probabilities. Thus it may
be noted that, in the instance just related, the vision was seen on the
steep side of Souter Fell. <i>Fell</i> means a hill or a steep rock, as
in Drachenfels. But as to Souter, although, as Mr. Robert Ferguson
says, the word may originally have meant sheep,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e5131src" href="#xd20e5131" name="xd20e5131src">7</a> it is found
in Scotland used as &lsquo;shoemaker&rsquo; in connection with the
fabulous giants of that region. Sir Thomas Urquhart, in the seventeenth
century, relates it as the tradition of the two promontories of
Cromarty, called &lsquo;Soutars,&rsquo; that they were the work-stools
of two giants who supplied their comrades with shoes and buskins.
Possessing but one set of implements, they used to fling these to each
other across the opening of the firth, where the promontories are only
two miles apart. In process of time the name Soutar, shoemaker, was
bequeathed by the craftsmen to their stools. It is not improbable that
the name gradually connected itself with other places bearing
traditions connecting them with the fabulous race, and that in this way
the Souter Fell, from meaning in early times much the same as
Giants&rsquo; Hill, preserved even in 1743&ndash;44 enough of the
earlier uncanny associations to awaken the awe of Borderers in a time
of rebellion. The vision may therefore have been seen by light which
had journeyed all the way from the mythologic <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb244" href="#v1pb244" name=
"v1pb244">244</a>]</span>heavens of ancient India: substantially
subjective&mdash;such stuff as dreams and dreamers are made of&mdash;no
doubt there were outer clouds, shapes and afterglows enough, even in
the absence of any <i>fata morgana</i> to supply canvas and pigment to
the cunning artist that hides in the eye.</p>
<p>In an old tale, the often-slain Vampyre-bat only requests, with
pathos, that his body may be laid where no sunlight, but only the
moonlight, will fall on it&mdash;only that! But it is under the
moonshine that it always gains new life. No demon requires absolute
darkness, but half-darkness, in which to live: enough light to disclose
a Somewhat, but not enough to define and reveal its nature, is just
what has been required for the bat-eyes of fable and phantasy, which
can make vampyre of a sparrow or giant out of a windmill.</p>
<p><i>Glamour!</i> A marvellous history has this word of the artists
and poets,&mdash;sometimes meaning the charm with which the eye invests
any object; or, in Wordsworth&rsquo;s phrase, &lsquo;the light that
never was on land or sea.&rsquo; But no artist or poet ever rose to the
full height of the simple term itself, which well illustrates
Emerson&rsquo;s saying, &lsquo;Words are fossil poetry.&rsquo;
Professor Cowell of Cambridge says: &lsquo;Gl&aacute;m, or in the
nominative <i>Gl&aacute;mr,</i> is also a poetical name for the Moon.
It does not actually occur in the ancient literature, but it is given
in the glossary in the Prose Edda in the list of the very old words for
the Moon.&rsquo; Vigfusson in his dictionary says, &lsquo;The word is
interesting on account of its identity with Scot. <i>Glamour</i>, which
shows that the tale of <i>Glam</i> was common to Scotland and Iceland,
and this much older than Grettir (in the year 1014).&rsquo; The Ghost
or Goblin Glam seems evidently to have arisen from a personification of
the delusive and treacherous effects of moonlight on the benighted
traveller, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb245" href="#v1pb245" name=

<p class="first">Now, there is a curious old Sanskrit word, <i>glau</i>
or <i>gl&aacute;v</i>, which is explained in all the old native
lexicons as meaning &lsquo;the moon.&rsquo; It might either be taken as
&lsquo;waning,&rsquo; or in a casual sense &lsquo;obscuring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The following lines from an early medi&aelig;val poet, Bh&aacute;sa
(seventh century), will illustrate the deceptive character of moonlight
from a Hindu point of view. The strong and wild Norse imagination
delights in what is terrible and gloomy: the Hindu loves to dwell on
the milder and quieter aspects of human life.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The cat laps the moonbeams in the bowl of water, thinking
them to be milk: the elephant thinks that the moonbeams, threaded
through the intervals of the trees, are the fibres of the lotus-stalk.
The woman snatches at the moonbeams as they lie on the bed, taking them
for her muslin garment: oh, how the moon, intoxicated with radiance,
bewilders all the world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A similar passage, no doubt imitated from this, is also quoted:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The bewildered herdsmen place the pails under the cows,
thinking that the milk is flowing; the maidens also put the blue lotus
blossom in their ears, thinking that it is the white; the
mountaineer&rsquo;s wife snatches up the jujube fruit, avaricious for
pearls. Whose mind is not led astray by the thickly clustering
moonbeams?&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5177src" href="#xd20e5177"
name="xd20e5177src">8</a></p>
<p>In the Icelandic legend of the struggle between the hero Grettir,
translated by Magn&uacute;ssen and Morris (London, 1869), the saga
supplies a scenery as arch&aelig;ological as if the philologists had
been consulted. &lsquo;Bright moonlight was there without, and the
drift was broken, now <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb246" href=
"#v1pb246" name="v1pb246">246</a>]</span>drawn over the moon, now
driven off from her; and even as Glam fell, a cloud was driven from the
moon, and Glam glared up against her.&rsquo; When the hero beheld these
glaring eyes of the giant Ghost, he felt some fiendish craft in them,
and could not draw his short sword, and &lsquo;lay well nigh
&lsquo;twixt home and hell.&rsquo; This half-light of the moon, which
robs the Strong of half his power, is repeated in Glam&rsquo;s curse:
&lsquo;Exceedingly eager hast thou sought to meet me, Grettir, but no
wonder will it be deemed, though thou gettest no good hap of me; and
this I must tell thee, that thou now hast got half the strength and
manhood which was thy lot if thou hadst not met me: now I may not take
from thee the strength which thou hast got before this; but that may I
rule, that thou shalt never be mightier than now thou art ... therefore
this weird I lay on thee, ever in those days to see these eyes with
thine eyes, and thou wilt find it hard to be alone&mdash;and that shalt
drag thee unto death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Moon-demon&rsquo;s power is limited to the spell of illusion he
can cast. Presently he is laid low; the &lsquo;short sword&rsquo; of a
sunbeam pales, decapitates him. But after Glam is burned to cold coals,
and his ashes buried in skin of a beast &lsquo;where sheep-pastures
were fewest, or the ways of men,&rsquo; the spell lay upon the
hero&rsquo;s eyes. &lsquo;Grettir said that his temper had been nowise
bettered by this, that he was worse to quiet than before, and that he
deemed all trouble worse than it was; but that herein he found the
greatest change, in that he was become so fearsome a man in the dark,
that he durst go nowhither alone after nightfall, for then he seemed to
see all kinds of horrors. And that has fallen since into a proverb,
that Glam lends eyes, or gives Glamsight to those who see things nowise
as they are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In reading which one may wonder how this world would <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb247" href="#v1pb247" name=
"v1pb247">247</a>]</span>look if for a little moment one&rsquo;s eyes
could be purged of glamour. Even at the moon&rsquo;s self one tries
vainly to look: where Hindu and Zulu see a hare, the Arab sees coils of
a serpent, and the Englishman sees a man; and the most intelligent of
these several races will find it hard to see in the moon aught save
what their primitive ancestors saw. And this small hint of the degree
to which the wisest, like Merlin, are bound fast in an air-prison by a
Vivien whose spells are spun from themselves, would carry us far could
we only venture to follow it out. &lsquo;The Moon,&rsquo; observed Dr.
Johnson unconsciously, &lsquo;has great influence in vulgar
philosophy.&rsquo; How much lunar theology have we around us, so that
many from the cradle to the grave get no clear sight of nature or of
themselves! Very closely did Carlyle come to the fable of Glam when
speaking of Coleridge&rsquo;s &lsquo;prophetic moonshine,&rsquo; and
its effect on poor John Sterling. &lsquo;If the bottled moonshine
<i>be</i>actually substance? Ah, could one but believe in a church
while finding it incredible!... The bereaved young lady <i>has</i>
taken the veil then!... To such lengths can transcendental moonshine,

fermenting life, act magically there, and produce divulsions and

Carlyle had ringing in his memory the old Scottish ballad of the Rev.
Robert Kirk, translator of the Psalms into Gaelic, who, while walking
in his night-gown at Aberfoyle, was &lsquo;snatched away to the joyless
Elfin bower.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A story is told of a man wandering on a dark night over Dartmoor,

voice was gone; and there he remained dangling in agony until the grey
light revealed that his feet were only a few inches from the solid
ground. Such are the chief demons that bind man till cockcrow. Such are
the apprehensions that waste also the moral and intellectual strength
of man, and murder his peace as he regards the necessary science of his
time to be cutting some frail tenure sustaining him over a bottomless

Fear.&rsquo; Perhaps even this story does not fully report the alliance
between the plague and fear; for it is hardly doubtful that epidemics
retain their power in the East largely because they have gained

<p>The demonisation of diseases is not wonderful. To thoughtful minds
not even science has dispelled the mystery which surrounds many of the
ailments that afflict mankind, especially the normal diseases besetting
children, hereditary complaints, and the strange liabilities to
infection and contagion. A genuine, however partial, observation would
suggest to primitive man some connection between the symptoms of many
diseases and the mysterious universe of which he could not yet
recognise himself an epitome. There were indications that certain
troubles of this kind were related to the seasons, consequently to the
celestial rulers of the seasons,&mdash;to the sun that smote by day,
and the moon at night. Professor Monier Williams, describing the
Devil-dances of Southern India, says that there seems to be an idea
among them that when pestilences are rife exceptional measures must be
taken to draw off the malignant spirits, supposed to cause them, by
tempting them to enter into these wild dancers, and so become
dissipated. He witnessed in Ceylon a dance performed by three men who
personated the forms and phases of typhus fever.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e5253src" href="#xd20e5253" name="xd20e5253src">2</a> These dances
probably belong to the same class of ideas as those of the dervishes in
Persia, whose manifold contortions are supposed to repeat the movements
of planets. They are invocations of the souls of good stars, and
propitiations of such as are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb251"
href="#v1pb251" name="v1pb251">251</a>]</span>evil. Belief in such
stellar and planetary influences has pervaded every part of the world,
and gave rise to astrological dances. &lsquo;Gebelin says that the
minuet was the <i>danse oblique</i> of the ancient priests of Apollo,
performed in their temples. The diagonal line and the two parallels
described in this dance were intended to be symbolical of the zodiac,
and the twelve steps of which it is composed were meant for the twelve
signs and the months of the year. The dance round the Maypole and the
Cotillon has the same origin. Diodorus tells us that Apollo was adored
with dances, and in the island of Iona the god danced all night. The
Christians of St. Thomas till a very late day celebrated their worship
with dances and songs. Calmet says there were dancing-girls in the
temple at Jerusalem.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5261src" href=
"#xd20e5261" name="xd20e5261src">3</a></p>
<p>The influence of the Moon upon tides, the sleeplessness it causes,
the restlessness of the insane under its occasional light, and such
treacheries of moonshine as we have already considered, have populated
our uninhabited satellite with demons. Lunar legends have decorated
some well-founded suspicions of moonlight. The mother draws the curtain
between the moonshine and her little Endymion, though not because she
sees in the waning moon a pining Selene whose kiss may waste away the
beauty of youth. A mere survival is the &lsquo;bowing to the new
moon:&rsquo; a euphonism traceable to many myths about
&lsquo;lunacy,&rsquo; among them, as I think, to Delilah
(&lsquo;languishing&rsquo;), in whose lap the solar Samson is shorn of
his locks, leaving him only the blind destructive strength of the
&lsquo;moonstruck.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the purely Semitic theories of the Jews we find diseases ascribed
to the wrath of Jehovah, and their cure to his merciful mood.
&lsquo;Jehovah will make thy plagues wonderful, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb252" href="#v1pb252" name=
"v1pb252">252</a>]</span>and the plagues of thy seed; ... he will bring
upon thee all the diseases of Egypt whereof thou wast
afraid.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5270src" href="#xd20e5270"
name="xd20e5270src">4</a> The emerods which smote the worshippers of
Dagon were ascribed directly to the hand of Jehovah.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e5275src" href="#xd20e5275" name="xd20e5275src">5</a> In that
vague degree of natural dualistic development which preceded the full
Iranian influence upon the Jews, the infliction of diseases was
delegated to an angel of Jehovah, as in the narratives of smiting the
firstborn of Egypt, wasting the army of Sennacherib, and the pestilence
sent upon Israel for David&rsquo;s sin. In the progress of this angel
to be a demon of disease we find a phase of ambiguity, as shown in the
hypochondria of Saul. &lsquo;The spirit of Jehovah departed from Saul,
and an evil spirit from Jehovah troubled him.&rsquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e5280src" href="#xd20e5280" name="xd20e5280src">6</a></p>
<p>All such ambiguities disappeared under the influence of Iranian
dualism. In the Book of Job we find the infliction of diseases and
plagues completely transferred to a powerful spirit, a fully formed
opposing potentate. The &lsquo;sons of God,&rsquo; who in the first
chapter of Job are said to have presented themselves before Jehovah,
may be identified in the thirty-eighth as the stars which shouted for
joy at the creation. Satan is the wandering or malign planet which
leads in the Ahrimanic side of the Persian planisphere. In the
cosmographical theology of that country Ormuzd was to reign for six
thousand years, and then Ahriman was to reign for a similar period. The
moral associations of this speculation are discussed elsewhere; it is
necessary here only to point out the bearing of the planispheric
conception upon the ills that flesh is heir to. Ahriman is the
&lsquo;star-serpent&rsquo; of the Zendavasta. &lsquo;When the
p&acirc;ris rendered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb253" href=
"#v1pb253" name="v1pb253">253</a>]</span>this world desolate, and
overran the universe; when the star-serpent made a path for himself
between heaven and earth,&rsquo; &amp;c.; &lsquo;when Ahriman rambles
on the earth, let him who takes the form of a serpent glide on the
earth; let him who takes the form of the wolf run on the earth, and let
the violent north wind bring weakness.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e5292src" href="#xd20e5292" name="xd20e5292src">7</a></p>
<p>The dawn of Ormuzd corresponds with April. The sun returns from
winter&rsquo;s death by sign of the lamb (our Aries), and thenceforth
every month corresponds with a thousand years of the reign of the
Beneficent. September is denoted by the Virgin and Child. To the dark
domain of Ahriman the prefecture of the universe passes by
Libra,&mdash;the same balances which appear in the hand of Satan. The
star-serpent prevails over the Virgin and Child. Then follow the months
of the scorpion, the centaur, goat, &amp;c., every month corresponding
to a thousand years of the reign of Ahriman.</p>
<p>While this scheme corresponds in one direction with the demons of
cold, and in another with the entrance and reign of moral evil in the
world, beginnings of disease on earth were also ascribed to this
seventh thousand of years when the Golden Age had passed. The depth of
winter is reached in domicile of the goat, or of Sirius, Seth, Saturn,
Satan&mdash;according to the many variants. And these, under their
several names, make the great &lsquo;infortune&rsquo; of astrology,
wherein old Culpepper amply instructed our fathers. &lsquo;In the
general, consider that <i>Saturn</i> is an old worn-out planet, weary,
and of little estimation in this world; he causeth long and tedious
sicknesses, abundance of sadness, and a Cartload of doubts and fears;
his nature is cold, and dry, and melancholy. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb254" href="#v1pb254" name=
"v1pb254">254</a>]</span>And take special notice of this, that when
Saturn is Lord of an Eclipse (as he is one of the Lords of this), he
governs all the rest of the planets, but none can govern him.
<i>Melancholy is made of all the humors in the body of man, but no
humor of melancholy.</i> He is envious, and keeps his anger long, and
speaks but few words, but when he speaks he speaks to purpose. A man of
deep cogitations; he will plot mischief when men are asleep; he hath an
admirable memory, and remembers to this day how <i>William</i> the
Bastard abused him; he cannot endure to be a slave; he is poor with the
poor, fearful with the fearful; he plots mischief against the
Superiours, with them that plot mischief against them; have a care of
him, <span class="sc">Kings</span> and <span class=
"sc">Magistrates</span> of Europe; he will show you what he can do in
the effects of this Eclipse; he is old, and therefore hath large
experience, and will give perilous counsel; he moves but slowly, and
therefore doth the more mischief; all the planets contribute their
natures and strength to him, and when he sets on doing mischief he will
do it to purpose; he doth not regard the company of the rest of the
Planets, neither do any of the rest of the Planets regard his; he is a
barren Planet, and therefore delights not in women; he brings the
Pestilence; he is destructive to the fruits of the earth; he receives
his light from the Sun, and yet he hates the Sun that gives it
him.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5320src" href="#xd20e5320" name=
"xd20e5320src">8</a></p>
<p>Many ages anterior to this began in India the dread of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb255" href="#v1pb255" name=
"v1pb255">255</a>]</span>Ketu, astronomically the ninth planet,
mythologically the tail of the demon Rahu, cut in twain as already told
(p. 46), supposed to be the prolific source of comets, meteors, and
falling stars, also of diseases. From this Ketu or dragon&rsquo;s tail
were born the Arunah Ketavah (Red Ketus or apparitions), and Ketu has
become almost another word for disease.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e5345src" href="#xd20e5345" name="xd20e5345src">9</a></p>
<p>Strongly influenced as were the Jews by the exact division of the
duodecimal period between Good and Evil, affirmed by the Persians, they
never lost sight of the ultimate supremacy of Jehovah. Though Satan had
gradually become a voluntary genius of evil, he still had to receive
permission to afflict, as in the case of Job, and during the lifetime
of Paul appears to have been still denied that &lsquo;power of
death&rsquo; which is first asserted by the unknown author of the
Epistle to the Hebrews.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5350src" href=
"#xd20e5350" name="xd20e5350src">10</a> Satan&rsquo;s especial office
was regarded as the infliction of disease. Paul delivers the incestuous
Corinthian to Satan &lsquo;for the destruction of the flesh,&rsquo; and
he also attributed the sickness and death of many to their
communicating unworthily.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5354src" href=
"#xd20e5354" name="xd20e5354src">11</a> He also recognises his own
&lsquo;thorn in the flesh&rsquo; as &lsquo;an angel from Satan,&rsquo;
though meant for his moral advantage.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e5362src" href="#xd20e5362" name="xd20e5362src">12</a></p>
<p>A penitential Psalm (Assyrian) reads as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>O my Lord! my sins are many, my trespasses are great; and the wrath
of the gods has plagued me with disease, and with sickness and
sorrow.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">I fainted, but no one stretched forth his hand!</p>
<p class="line">I groaned, but no one drew nigh!</p>
<p class="line">I cried aloud, but no one heard!</p>
<p class="line">O Lord, do not abandon thy servant!</p>
<p class="line">In the waters of the great storm seize his hand!
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb256" href="#v1pb256" name=
"v1pb256">256</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">The sins which he has committed turn them to
righteousness.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5385src" href="#xd20e5385"
name="xd20e5385src">13</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">This Psalm would hardly be out of place in the English
burial-service, which deplores death as a visitation of divine wrath.
Wherever such an idea prevails, the natural outcome of it is a belief
in demons of disease. In ancient Egypt&mdash;following the belief in Ra
the Sun, from whose eyes all pleasing things proceeded, and Set, from
whose eyes came all noxious things,&mdash;from the baleful light of
Set&rsquo;s eyes were born the Seven Hathors, or Fates, whose names are
recorded in the Book of the Dead. Mr. Fox Talbot has translated
&lsquo;the Song of the Seven Spirits:&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">They are seven! they are seven!</p>
<p class="line">In the depths of ocean they are seven!</p>
<p class="line">In the heights of heaven they are seven!</p>
<p class="line">In the ocean-stream in a palace they were born!</p>
<p class="line">Male they are not: female they are not!</p>
<p class="line">Wives they have not: children are not born to them!</p>
<p class="line">Rule they have not: government they know not!</p>
<p class="line">Prayers they hear not!</p>
<p class="line">They are seven! they are seven! twice over they are
seven!<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5409src" href="#xd20e5409" name=
"xd20e5409src">14</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">These demons have a way of herding together; the
Assyrian tablets abundantly show that their occupation was manifested
by diseases, physical and mental. One prescription runs
thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The god (...) shall stand by his bedside:</p>
<p class="line">Those seven evil spirits he shall root out, and shall
expel them from his body:</p>
<p class="line">And those seven shall never return to the sick man
again!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">It is hardly doubtful that these were the seven said
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb257" href="#v1pb257" name=
"v1pb257">257</a>]</span>have been cast out of Mary Magdalen; for their
father Set is <i>Shed&icirc;m</i> (devils) of Deut. xxxii. 17, and
<i>Shaddai</i> (God) of Gen. xvi. 1. But the fatal Seven turn to the
seven fruits that charm away evil influences at parturition in Persia,
also the Seven Wise Women of the same country traditionally present on
holy occasions. When Ard&aacute; Vir&aacute;f was sent to Paradise by a
sacred narcotic to obtain intelligence of the true faith, seven fires
were kept burning for seven days around him, and the seven wise women
chanted hymns of the Avesta.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5449src" href=
"#xd20e5449" name="xd20e5449src">15</a></p>
<p>The entrance of the seven evil powers into a dwelling was believed
by the Assyrians to be preventible by setting in the doorway small
images, such as those of the sun-god (Hea) and the moon-goddess, but
especially of Marduk, corresponding to Serapis the Egyptian Esculapius.
These powers were reinforced by writing holy texts over and on each
side of the threshold. &lsquo;In the night time bind around the sick
man&rsquo;s head a sentence taken from a good book.&rsquo; The
phylacteries of the Jews were originally worn for the same purpose.
They were called Tefila, and were related to <i>teraphim,</i> the
little idols<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5457src" href="#xd20e5457"
name="xd20e5457src">16</a> used by the Jews to keep out
demons&mdash;such as those of Laban, which his daughter Rachel
stole.</p>
<p>The resemblance of teraphim to the Tarasca (connected by some with
G. <span class="trans" title="teras"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&tau;&#8051;&rho;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span></span>, a monster) of
Spain may be noted,&mdash;the serpent figures carried about in Corpus
Christi processions. The latter word is known in the south of France
also, and gave its name to the town Tarascon. The legend is that an
amphibious monster haunted the Rhone, preventing navigation and
committing terrible ravages, until sixteen of the boldest inhabitants
of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb258" href="#v1pb258" name=
"v1pb258">258</a>]</span>district resolved to encounter it. Eight lost
their lives, but the others, having destroyed the monster, founded the
town of Tarascon, where the &lsquo;<span lang="fr">F&ecirc;te de la
tarasque</span>&rsquo; is still kept up.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e5479src" href="#xd20e5479" name="xd20e5479src">17</a> Calmet,
Sedley, and others, however, believe that <i>teraphim</i> is merely a
modification of seraphim, and the Tefila, or phylacteries, of the same
origin.</p>
<p>The phylactery was tied into a knot. Justin Martyr says that the
Jewish exorcists used &lsquo;magic ties or knots.&rsquo; The origin of
this custom among the Jews and Babylonians may be found in the Assyrian
Talismans preserved in the British Museum, of which the following has
been translated by Mr. Fox Talbot:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Hea says: Go, my son!</p>
<p class="line">Take a woman&rsquo;s kerchief,</p>
<p class="line">Bind it round thy right hand, loose it from the left
hand!</p>
<p class="line">Knot it with seven knots: do so twice:</p>
<p class="line">Sprinkle it with bright wine:</p>
<p class="line">Bind it round the head of the sick man:</p>
<p class="line">Bind it round his hands and feet, like manacles and
fetters.</p>
<p class="line">Sit down on his bed:</p>
<p class="line">Sprinkle holy water over him.</p>
<p class="line">He shall hear the voice of Hea,</p>

<p class="first">The number seven holds an equally high degree of
potency in Singhalese demonolatry, which is mainly occupied with
diseases. The Capuas or conjurors of that island enumerate 240,000
magic spells, of which all except one are for evil, which implies a
tolerably large preponderance of the emergencies in which their
countervailing efforts are required by their neighbours. That of course
can be easily appreciated by those who have been taught that all human
beings are included under a primal curse. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb259" href="#v1pb259" name="v1pb259">259</a>]</span>The words of
Micah, &lsquo;Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the
sea,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5523src" href="#xd20e5523" name=
"xd20e5523src">19</a> are recalled by the legend of these evil spells
of Ceylon. The king of Oude came to marry one of seven princesses, all
possessing pr&aelig;ternatural powers, and questioned each as to her
art. Each declared her skill in doing harm, except one who asserted her
power to heal all ills which the others could inflict. The king having
chosen this one as his bride, the rest were angry, and for revenge
collected all the charms in the world, enclosed them in a
pumpkin&mdash;the only thing that can contain spells without being
reduced to ashes&mdash;and sent this infernal machine to their sister.
It would consume everything for sixteen hundred miles round; but the
messenger dropped it in the sea. A god picked it up and presented it to
the King of Ceylon, and these, with the healing charm known to his own
Queen, make the 240,000 spells known to the Capuas of that island, who
have no doubt deified the rescuer of the spells on the same principle
that inspires some seaside populations to worship Providence more
devoutly on the Sunday after a valuable wreck in their
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The astrological origin of the evils ascribed to the Yakseyo
(Demons) of Ceylon, and the horoscope which is a necessary preliminary
to any dealing with their influences; the constant recurrence of the
number seven, denoting origin with races holding the seven-planet
theories of the universe; and the fact that all demons are said, on
every Saturday evening, to attend an assemblage called <i>Yaksa
Sabawa</i> (Witches&rsquo; Sabbath), are facts that may well engage the
attention of Comparative Mythologists.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The largest proportion of the Disease Demons of Ceylon are descended
from its Hunger Demons. The Preta there is much the same phantom as in
Siam, only they are not quite so tall.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e5548src" href="#xd20e5548" name="xd20e5548src">21</a> They range
from two to four hundred feet in height, and are so numerous that a
Pali Buddhist book exhorts people not to throw stones, lest they should
harm one of these harmless starveling ghosts, who die many times of
hunger, and revive to suffer on in expiation of their sins in a
previous existence. They are harmless in one sense, but filthy; and bad
smells are personified in them. The great mass of demons resemble the
Pretraya, in that their king (Wessamony) has forbidden them to satisfy
themselves directly upon their victims, but by inflicting diseases they
are supposed to receive an imaginative satisfaction somewhat like that
of eating people.</p>
<p>Reeri is the Demon of Blood-disease. His form is that of a man with
face of a monkey; he is fiery red, rides on a red bull, and all
hemorrhages and diseases of the blood are attributed to him. Reeri has
eighteen different disguises or avatars. One of these recalls his
earlier position as a demon of death, before Vishnu revealed to Capuas
the means of binding him: he is now supposed to be present at every
death-bed in the form of a delighted pigmy, one span and six inches
high. On such occasions he bears a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb261" href="#v1pb261" name="v1pb261">261</a>]</span>cock in one
hand, a club in the other, and in his mouth a corpse. In the same
country Maha Sohon is the &lsquo;great graveyard demon.&rsquo; He
resides in a hill where he is supposed to surround himself with
carcases. He is 122 feet high, has four hands and three eyes, and a red
skin. He has the head of a bear; the legend being that while
quarrelling with another giant his head was knocked off, and the god
Senasura was gracious enough to tear off the head of a bear and clap it
on the decapitated giant. His capua threatens him with a repetition of
this catastrophe if he does not spare any threatened victim who has
called in his priestly aid. Except for this timidity about his head,
Maha is formidable, being chief of 30,000 demons. But curiously enough
he is said to choose for his steeds the more innocent
animals,&mdash;goat, deer, horse, elephant, and hog.</p>
<p>One of the demons most dreaded in Ceylon is the &lsquo;Foreign
Demon&rsquo; Morotoo, said to have come from the coast of Malabar, and
from his residence in a tree disseminated diseases which could not be
cured until, the queen being afflicted, one capua was found able to
master him. Seven-eighths of the charms used in restraining the
disease-demons of Ceylon, of which I have mentioned but a few, are in
the Tamil tongue. In various parts of India are found very nearly the
same systematic demonolatry and &lsquo;devil-dancing;&rsquo; for
example in Travancore, to whose superstitions of this character the
Rev. Samuel Mateer has devoted two chapters in his work &lsquo;The Land
of Charity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The great demon of diseases in Ceylon is entitled Maha Cola Sanni
Yakseya. His father, a king, ordered his queen to be put to death in
the belief that she had been faithless to him. Her body was to be cut
in two pieces, one of which was to be hung upon a tree
(<i>Ukberiya</i>), the other to be thrown at its foot to the dogs. The
queen before her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb262" href="#v1pb262"
name="v1pb262">262</a>]</span>execution said, &lsquo;If this charge be
false, may the child in my womb be born this instant a demon, and may
that demon destroy the whole of this city and its unjust king.&rsquo;
So soon as the executioners had finished their work, the two severed
parts of the queen&rsquo;s body reunited, a child was born who
completely devoured his mother, and then repaired to the graveyard
(Sohon), where for a time he fattened on corpses. Then he proceeded to
inflict mortal diseases upon the city, and had nearly depopulated it
when the gods Iswara and Sekkra interfered, descending to subdue him in
the disguise of mendicants. Possibly the great Maha Sohon mentioned
above, and the Sohon (graveyard) from which Sanni dealt out deadliness,
may be best understood by the statement of the learned writer from whom
these facts are quoted, that, &lsquo;excepting the Buddhist priests,
and the aristocrats of the land, whose bodies were burnt in regular
funeral-piles after death, the corpses of the rest of the people were
neither burned nor buried, but thrown into a place called
<i>Sohona</i>, which was an open piece of ground in the jungle,
generally a hollow among the hills, at the distance of three or four
miles from any inhabited place, where they were left in the open air to
be decomposed or devoured by dogs and wild beasts.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e5567src" href="#xd20e5567" name=
"xd20e5567src">22</a> There would appear to be even more ground for the
dread of the Great Graveyard Demon in many parts of Christendom, where,
through desire to preserve corpses for a happy resurrection, they are
made to steal through the water-veins of the earth, and find their
resurrection as fell diseases. Iswara and Sekkra were probably two
reformers who persuaded the citizens to bury the poor deep in the
earth; had they been wise enough to place the dead where nature would
give them speedy resurrection and life in grass and flowers, it would
not have been further recorded <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb263"
href="#v1pb263" name="v1pb263">263</a>]</span>that &lsquo;they ordered
him (the demon) to abstain from eating men, but gave him Wurrun or
permission to inflict disease on mankind, and to obtain
offerings.&rsquo; This is very much the same as the privilege given our
Western funeral agencies and cemeteries also; and when the Modliar adds
that Sanni &lsquo;has eighteen principal attendants,&rsquo; one can
hardly help thinking of the mummers, gravediggers, chaplains, all
engaged unconsciously in the work of making the earth less
habitable.</p>
<p>The first of the attendants of this formidable avenger of his
mother&rsquo;s wrongs is named Bhoota Sanni Yakseya, Demon of Madness.
The whole demonolatry and devil-dancing of that island are so insane
that one is not surprised that this Bhoota had but little special
development. It is amid clear senses we might naturally look for full
horror of madness, and there indeed do we find it. One of the most
horrible forms of the disease-demon was the personification of madness
among the Greeks, as Mania.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5574src" href=
"#xd20e5574" name="xd20e5574src">23</a> In the <i>Hercules Furens</i>
of Euripides, where Madness, &lsquo;the unwedded daughter of black
Night,&rsquo; and sprung of &lsquo;the blood of C&oelig;lus,&rsquo; is
evoked from Tartarus for the express purpose of imbreeding in Hercules
&lsquo;child-slaying disturbances of reason,&rsquo; there is a
suggestion of the hereditary nature of insanity. Obedient to the
vindictive order of Juno, &lsquo;in her chariot hath gone forth the
marble-visaged, all-mournful Madness, the Gorgon of Night, and with the
hissing of hundred heads of snakes, she gives the goad to her chariot,
on mischief bent.&rsquo; We may plainly see that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb264" href="#v1pb264" name=
"v1pb264">264</a>]</span>religion which embodied such a form was itself
ending in madness. Already ancient were the words <span class="trans"
title="mantik&#275;"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&mu;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#8052;</span></span> (prophecy)
and <span class="trans" title="manik&#275;"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&mu;&alpha;&nu;&iota;&kappa;&#8052;</span></span> (madness) when
Plato cited their identity to prove one kind of madness the special
gift of Heaven:<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5605src" href="#xd20e5605"
name="xd20e5605src">24</a> the notion lingers in Dryden&rsquo;s line,
&lsquo;Great wits to madness sure are near allied;&rsquo; and survive
in regions where deference is paid to lunatics and idiots. Other
diseases preserve in their names indications of similar association:
<i>e.g.</i>, Nympholepsy, St. Vitus&rsquo;s Dance, St. Anthony&rsquo;s
Fire. Wesley attributes still epilepsy to &lsquo;possession.&rsquo;
This was in pursuance of ancient beliefs. Typhus, a name anciently
given to every malady accompanied with stupor (<span class="trans"
title="typhos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&tau;&#8166;&phi;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>), seemed the
breath of feverish Typhon. Max M&uuml;ller connects the word
<i>quinsy</i> with Sanskrit <i>amh</i>, &lsquo;to throttle,&rsquo; and
Ahi the throttling serpent, its medium being <i>angina</i>; and this
again is <span class="trans" title="kynanch&#275;"><span class="Greek"
lang="el">&kappa;&upsilon;&nu;&#8049;&gamma;&chi;&eta;</span></span>,
dog-throttling, the Greek for quinsy.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The genius of William Blake, steeped in Hebraism, never showed
greater power than in his picture of Plague. A gigantic hideous form,
pale-green, with the slime of stagnant pools, reeking with vegetable
decays and gangrene, the face livid with the motley tints of pallor and
putrescence, strides onward with extended arms like a sower sowing his
seeds, only in this case the germs of his horrible harvest are not cast
from the hands, but emanate from the fingers as being of their essence.
Such, to the savage mind, was the embodiment of malaria, sultriness,
rottenness, the putrid Pretraya, invisible, but smelt and felt. Such,
to the ignorant imagination, is the Destroying Angel to which
rationalistic artists and poets have tried to add wings and majesty;
but which in the popular mind was no doubt pictured more like this form
found at Ostia <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb265" href="#v1pb265"
name="v1pb265">265</a>]</span>(<a href="#v1fig16">fig. 16</a>), and now
passing in the Vatican for a Satan,&mdash;probably a demon of the
Pontine Marshes, and of the fever that still has victims of its fatal
cup (p. 291). In these fearful forms the poor savage believed with such
an intensity that he was able to shape the brain of man to his
phantasy; bringing about the anomaly that the great reformer, Luther,
should affirm, even while fighting superstition, that a Christian ought
to know that he lives in the midst of devils, and that the devil is
nearer to him than his coat or his shirt. The devils, he tells us, are
all around us, and are at every moment seeking to ensnare our lives,
salvation, and happiness. There are many of them in the woods, waters,
deserts, and in damp muddy places, for the purpose of doing folk a
mischief. They also house in the dense black clouds, and send storms,
hail, thunder and lightning, and poison the air with their infernal
stench. In one place, Luther tells us that the devil has more vessels
and boxes full of poison, with which he kills people, than all the
apothecaries in the whole world. He sends all plagues and diseases
among men. We may be sure that when any one dies of the pestilence, is
drowned, or drops suddenly dead, the devil does it.</p>

<p>Knowing nothing of Zoology, the primitive man easily falls into the
belief that his cattle&mdash;the means of life&mdash;may be the
subjects of sorcery. Jesus sending devils into a herd of swine may have
become by artificial process a divine benefactor in the eye of
Christendom, but the myth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb266" href=
"#v1pb266" name="v1pb266">266</a>]</span>makes Him bear an exact
resemblance to the dangerous sorcerer that fills the savage mind with
dread. It is probable that the covetous eye denounced in the decalogue
means the evil eye, which was supposed to blight an object intensely
desired but not to be obtained.</p>
<p>Gopolu, already referred to (p. 136) as the Singhalese demon of
hydrophobia, bears the general name of the &lsquo;Cattle Demon.&rsquo;
He is said to have been the twin of the demigod Mangara by a queen on
the Coromandel coast. The mother died, and a cow suckled the twins, but
afterwards they quarrelled, and Gopolu being slain was transformed into
a demon. He repaired to Arangodde, and fixed his abode in a Banyan
where there is a large bee-hive, whence proceed many evils. The
population around this Banyan for many miles being prostrated by
diseases, the demigod Mangara and Pattini (goddess of chastity)
admonished the villagers to sacrifice a cow regularly, and thus they
were all resuscitated. Gopolu now sends all cattle diseases. India is
full of the like superstitions. The people of Travancore especially
dread the demon Madan, &lsquo;he who is like a cow,&rsquo; believed to
strike oxen with sudden illness,&mdash;sometimes men also.</p>
<p>In Russia we find superstition sometimes modified by common sense.
Though the peasant hopes that Zegory (St. George) will defend his
cattle, he begins to see the chief foes of his cattle. As in the
folk-song&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">We have gone around the field,</p>

<p class="line">O thou, our brave Zegory,</p>

<p class="first">Nevertheless when a cattle plague occurs many villages
relapse into a normally extinct state of mind. Thus, a few years ago,
in a village near Moscow, all the women, having warned the men away,
stripped themselves entirely naked and drew a plough so as to make a
furrow entirely around the village. At the point of juncture in this
circle they buried alive a cock, a cat, and a dog. Then they filled the
air with lamentations, crying&mdash;&lsquo;Cattle Plague! Cattle
Plague! spare our cattle! Behold, we offer thee cock, cat, and
dog!&rsquo; The dog is a demonic character in Russia, while the cat is
sacred; for once when the devil tried to get into Paradise in the form
of a mouse, the dog allowed him to pass, but the cat pounced on
him&mdash;the two animals being set on guard at the door. The offering
of both seems to represent a desire to conciliate both sides. The
nudity of the women may have been to represent to the hungry gods their
utter poverty, and inability to give more; but it was told me in
Moscow, where I happened to be staying at the time, that it would be
dangerous for any man to draw near during the performance.</p>
<p>In Altmark<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5700src" href="#xd20e5700"
name="xd20e5700src">27</a> the demons who bewitch cattle are called
&lsquo;Bihlweisen,&rsquo; and are believed to bury certain diabolical
charms under thresholds over which the animals are to pass, causing
them to wither away, the milk to cease, etc. The prevention is to wash
the cattle with a lotion of sea cabbage boiled with infusion of wine.
In the same province it is related that once there appeared in a
harvest-field at one time fifteen, at another twelve men (apparently),
the latter headless. They all laboured with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb268" href="#v1pb268" name=
"v1pb268">268</a>]</span>scythes, but though the rustling could be
heard no grain fell. When questioned they said nothing, and when the
people tried to seize them they ran away, cutting fruitlessly as they
ran. The priests found in this a presage of the coming cattle plague.
The Russian superstition of the plough, above mentioned, is found in
fragmentary survivals in Altmark. Thus, it is said that to plough
around a village and then sit under the plough (placed upright), will
enable any one to see the witches; and in some villages, some bit of a
plough is hung up over a doorway through which cattle pass, as no devil
can then approach them. The demons have a natural horror of honest
work, and especially the culture of the earth. Goethe, as we have seen,
notes their fear of roses: perhaps he remembered the legend of Aspasia,
who, being disfigured by a tumour on the chin, was warned by a
dove-maiden to dismiss her physicians and try a rose from the garland
of Venus; so she recovered health and beauty. <span class=

The legal prosecutions of the &lsquo;Peculiar People&rsquo; for obeying

this sanctity of the number seven it may be remarked that it has spread

of the Spirit, seven sins and virtues. It is easy therefore to mistake
orthodox doctrines for survivals. In the London &lsquo;Times&rsquo; of
June 24, 1875, there was reported an inquest at Corsham, Wiltshire, on
the body of Miriam Woodham, who died under the prescriptions of William
Bigwood, herbalist. It was shown that he used pills made of seven
herbs. This was only shown to be a &lsquo;pagan survival<span class=

<p class="first">Savage races believe that no man dies except by
sorcery. Therefore every death must be avenged. The Actas of the
Philippines regard the &lsquo;Indians&rsquo; as the cause of the deaths
among them; and when one of them loses a relative, he lurks and watches
until he has spied an &lsquo;Indian&rsquo; and killed him.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e5718src" href="#xd20e5718" name="xd20e5718src">1</a>
It is a progress from this when primitive man advances to the belief
that the fatal sorcerer is an invisible man&mdash;a demon. When this
doctrine is taught in the form of a belief that death entered the world
through the machinations of Satan, and was not in the original scheme
of creation, it is civilised; but when it is inculcated under a set of
African or other non-christian names, it is barbarian.</p>
<p>The following sketch, by Mr. Gideon Lang, will show the intensity of
this conviction among the natives of New South Wales:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;While at Nanima I constantly saw one of these, named Jemmy, a
remarkably fine man, about twenty-eight years <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb270" href="#v1pb270" name=
"v1pb270">270</a>]</span>of age, who was the &lsquo;model
Christian&rsquo; of the missionaries, and who had been over and over
again described in their reports as a living proof that, taken in
infancy, the natives were as capable of being truly christianised as a
people who had had eighteen centuries of civilisation. I confess that I
strongly doubted, but still there was no disputing the apparent facts.
Jemmy was not only familiar with the Bible, which he could read
remarkably well, but he was even better acquainted with the more
abstruse tenets of christianity; and so far as the whites could see,
his behaviour was in accordance with his religious acquirements. One
Sunday morning I walked down to the black fellows&rsquo; camp, to have
a talk with Jemmy, as usual. I found him sitting in his gunyah,
overlooking a valley of the Macquarrie, whose waters glanced brightly
in the sunshine of the delicious spring morning. He was sitting in a
state of nudity, excepting his waistcloth, very earnestly reading the
Bible, which indeed was his constant practice; and I could see that he
was perusing the Sermon on the Mount. I seated myself, and waited till
he concluded the chapter, when he laid down the Bible, folded his
hands, and sat with his eyes fixed abstractedly on his fire. I bade him
&lsquo;good morning,&rsquo; which he <span class="corr" id="xd20e5727"
title="Source: acknowleged">acknowledged</span> without looking up. I
then said, &lsquo;Jemmy, what is the meaning of your spears being stuck
in a circle round you?&rsquo; He looked me steadily in the eyes, and
said solemnly and with suppressed fierceness, &lsquo;Mother&rsquo;s
dead!&rsquo; I said that I was very sorry to hear it; &lsquo;but what
had her death to do with the spears being stuck around so?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Bogan black-fellow killed her!&rsquo; was the fierce and gloomy
reply. &lsquo;Killed by a Bogan black!&rsquo; I exclaimed: &lsquo;why,
your mother has been dying a fortnight, and Dr. Curtis did not expect
her to outlive last night, which you know as well as I do.&rsquo; His
only reply was a dogged <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb271" href=
"#v1pb271" name="v1pb271">271</a>]</span>repetition of the words:
&lsquo;A Bogan black-fellow killed her!&rsquo; I appealed to him as a
Christian&mdash;to the Sermon on the Mount, that he had just been
reading; but he absolutely refused to promise that he would not avenge
his mother&rsquo;s death. In the afternoon of that day we were startled
by a yell which can never be mistaken by any person who has once heard
the wild war-whoop of the blacks when in battle array. On marching out
we saw all the black fellows of the neighbourhood formed into a line,
and following Jemmy in an imaginary attack upon an enemy. Jemmy himself
disappeared that evening. On the following Wednesday morning I found
him sitting complacently in his gunyah, plaiting a rope of human hair,
which I at once knew to be that of his victim. Neither of us spoke; I
stood for some time watching him as he worked with a look of mocking
defiance of the anger he knew I felt. I pointed to a hole in the middle
of his fire, and said, &lsquo;Jemmy, the proper place for your Bible is
there.&rsquo; He looked up with his eyes flashing as I turned away, and
I never saw him again. I afterwards learned that he had gone to the
district of the Bogan tribe, where the first black he met happened to
be an old friend and companion of his own. This man had just made the
first cut in the bark of a tree, which he was about to climb for an
opossum; but on hearing footsteps he leaped down and faced round, as
all blacks do, and whites also, when blacks are in question. Seeing
that it was only Jemmy, however, he resumed his occupation, but had no
sooner set to work than Jemmy sent a spear through his back and nailed
him to the tree.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5732src" href="#xd20e5732"
name="xd20e5732src">2</a></p>
<p>Perhaps if Jemmy could have been cross-examined by the
non-missionary mind, he might have replied with some effect to Mr.
Lang&rsquo;s suggestion that he ought to part with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb272" href="#v1pb272" name=
"v1pb272">272</a>]</span>his Bible. Surely he must have found in that
volume a sufficient number of instances to justify his faith in the
power of demons over human health and life. Might he not have pondered
the command, &lsquo;thou shalt not suffer a witch to live,&rsquo; and
imagined that he was impaling another Manasseh, who &lsquo;used
enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit,
and with wizards (and) wrought much evil in the sight of the Lord to
provoke Him to anger.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5739src" href=
"#xd20e5739" name="xd20e5739src">3</a> Those who hope that the Bible
may carry light into the dark places of superstition and habitations of
cruelty might, one would say, reflect upon the long contest which
European science had with bibliolators in trying to relieve the popular
mind from the terrors of witchcraft, whose genuineness it was (justly)
declared contrary to the Scriptures to deny. There are districts in
Great Britain and America, and many more on the continent of Europe,
where the spells that waste and destroy are still believed in; where
effigies of wax or even onions are labelled with some hated name, and
stuck over with pins, and set near fires to be melted or dried up, in
full belief that some subject of the charm will be consumed by disease
along with the object used. Under every roof where such coarse
superstitions dwell the Bible dwells beside them, and experience proves
that the infallibility of all such talismans diminishes <i>pari
passu</i>.</p>

</div>
<p>What the savage is really trying to slay when he goes forth to
avenge his relative&rsquo;s death on the first alien he finds may be
seen in the accompanying figure (<a href="#v1fig17">17</a>), which
represents the Mexican goddess of death&mdash;Teoyaomiqui. The image is
nine feet high, and is kept in a museum in the city of Mexico. Mr.
Edward B. Tylor, from whose excellent book of travels in that country
the figure is copied, says of it:&mdash;&lsquo;The stone known as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb273" href="#v1pb273" name=
"v1pb273">273</a>]</span>the statue of the war-goddess is a huge block
of basalt covered with sculptures. The antiquaries think that the
figures on it stand for different personages, and that it is three
gods&mdash;Huitzilopochtli, the god of war; Teoyaomiqui, his wife; and
Mictlanteuctli, the god of hell. It has necklaces of alternate hearts
and dead men&rsquo;s hands, with death&rsquo;s heads for a central
ornament. At the bottom of the block is a strange sprawling figure,
which one cannot <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb274" href="#v1pb274"
name="v1pb274">274</a>]</span>see now, for it is the base which rests
on the ground; but there are two shoulders projecting from the idol,
which show plainly that it did not stand on the ground, but was
supported aloft on the tops of two pillars. The figure carved upon the
bottom represents a monster holding a skull in each hand, while others
hang from his knees and elbows. His mouth is a mere oval ring, a common
feature of Mexican idols, and four tusks project just above it. The new
moon laid down like a bridge forms his forehead, and a star is placed
on each side of it. This is thought to have been the conventional
representation of Mictlanteuctli (Lord of the Land of the Dead), the
god of hell, which was a place of utter and <span class="corr" id=
"xd20e5763" title="Source: eteranal">eternal</span> darkness. Probably
each victim as he was led to the altar could look up between the two
pillars and see the hideous god of hell staring down upon him from
above. There is little doubt that this is the famous war-idol which
stood on the great teocalli of Mexico, and before which so many
thousands of human beings were sacrificed. It lay undisturbed under
ground in the great square, close to the very site of the teocalli,
until sixty years ago. For many years after that it was kept buried,
lest the sight of one of their old deities might be too exciting for
the Indians, who, as I have mentioned before, had certainly not
forgotten it, and secretly ornamented it with garlands of flowers while
it remained above ground.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If my reader will now turn to the (<a href="#v1fig11">fig. 11</a>)
portrait of the Demon of Serpents, he will find a conception
fundamentally similar to the Mexican demoness of death or slaughter,
but one that is not shut up in a museum of antiquities; it still haunts
and terrifies a vast number of the people born in Ceylon. He is the
principal demon invoked in Ceylon by the malignant sorcerers in
performing the 84,000 different charms that afflict evils
(<i>Hooniyan</i>). His <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb275" href=
"#v1pb275" name="v1pb275">275</a>]</span>general title is <span class=
"sc">Oddy Cumara Hooniyan Dewatawa</span>; but he has a special name
for each of his six several apparitions, the chief of these being Cali
Oddisey, or demon of incurable diseases, therefore of death, and Naga
Oddisey, demon of serpents&mdash;deadliest of animals. Beneath him is
the Pale Horse which has had its career so long and far,&mdash;even to
the White Mare on which, in some regions, Christ is believed to revisit
the earth every Christmas; and also the White Mare of Yorkshire
Folklore which bore its rider from Whitestone Cliff to hell. This
Singhalese form also, albeit now associated by Capuas with fatal
disease, was probably at first, like the Mexican, a war goddess and god
combined, as is shown by the uplifted sword, and reeking hand uplifted
in triumph. Equally a god of war is our &lsquo;Death on the Pale
Horse,&rsquo; which christian art, following the so-called Apocalypse,
has made so familiar. &lsquo;I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his
name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power
was given to him over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword,
and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the
earth.&rsquo; This is but a travesty of the Greek Ares, the Roman Mars,
or god of War. In the original Greek-form Ares was not solely the god
of war, but of destruction generally. In the &OElig;dipus Tyrannus of
Sophocles we have the popular conception of him as one to whom the
deadly plague is ascribed. He is named as the &lsquo;god unhonoured
among gods,&rsquo; and it is said:&mdash;&lsquo;The city is wildly
tossing, and no more can lift up her head from the waves of death;
withering the ripening grain in the husks, withering the kine in their
pastures; blighted are the babes through the failing labours of women;
the fire-bearing god, horrid Pestilence, having darted down, ravages
the city; by him the house <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb276" href=
"#v1pb276" name="v1pb276">276</a>]</span>of Cadmus is empty, and dark
Hades enriched with groans and lamentations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mother of the deadliest &lsquo;Calas&rsquo; of Singhalese
demonolatry, sister of the Scandinavian Hel in name and nature, is
Kali. Although the Hindu writers repudiate the idea that there is any
devil among their three hundred and thirty millions of deities, it is
difficult to deny Kali that distinction. Her wild dance of delight over
bodies of the slain would indicate pleasure taken in destruction for
its own sake, so fulfilling the definition of a devil; but, on the
other hand, there is a Deccan legend that reports her as devouring the
dead, and this would make her a hunger-demon. We may give her the
benefit of the doubt, and class her among the demons&mdash;or beings
whose evil is not gratuitous&mdash;all the more because the
mysteriously protruding tongue, as in the figure of Typhon (p. 185),
probably suggests thirst. Hindu legend does, indeed, give another
interpretation, and say that when she was dancing for joy at having
slain a hundred-headed giant demigod, the shaking of the earth was so
formidable that Siva threw himself among the slain, whom she was
crushing at every step, hoping to induce her to pause; but when,
unheeding, she trod upon the body of her husband, she paused and thrust
out her tongue from surprise and shame. The Vedic description of Agni
as an <i>ugra</i> (ogre), with &lsquo;tongue of flame,&rsquo; may
better interpret Kali&rsquo;s tongue. It is said Kali is pleased for a
hundred years by the blood of a tiger; for a thousand by that of a man;
for a hundred thousand by the blood of three men.</p>
<div class="figure xd20e5788width" id="v1fig18"><img src=
"images/fig118.jpg" alt="Fig. 18.&mdash;Kali." width="430" height=

<p class="figureHead">Fig. 18.&mdash;<span class="sc">Kali.</span></p>
</div>
<p>How are we to understand this dance of Death, and the further legend
of her tossing dead bodies into the air for amusement? Such a figure
found among a people who shudder at taking life even from the lowest
animals is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb277" href="#v1pb277" name=
"v1pb277">277</a>]</span>hardly to be explained by the destructiveness
of nature personified in her spouse Siva. Her looks and legends
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb278" href="#v1pb278" name=
"v1pb278">278</a>]</span>alike represent slaughter by human violence.
May it not be that Kali represents some period when the abhorrence of
taking life among a vegetarian people&mdash;a people, too, believing in
transmigration&mdash;might have become a public danger? When Krishna
appeared it was, according to the Bh&aacute;gavat Gita, as charioteer
inciting Arjoon to war. There must have been various periods when a
peaceful people must fall victims to more savage neighbours unless they
could be stimulated to enter on the work of destruction with a light
heart. There may have been periods when the human Kalis of India might
stimulate their husbands and sons to war with such songs as the women
of Dardistan sing at the Feast of Fire (p. 91). The amour of the Greek
goddess of Beauty with the god of War, leaving her lawful spouse the
Smith, is full of meaning. The Assyrian Venus, Istar, appeared in a
vision, with wings and halo, bearing a bow and arrow for Assurbanipal.
The Thug appears to have taken some such view of Kali, regarding her as
patroness of their plan for reducing population. They are said to have
claimed that Kali left them one of her teeth for a pickaxe, her rib for
a knife, her garment&rsquo;s hem for a noose, and wholesale murder for
a religion. The uplifted right hand of the demoness has been
interpreted as intimating a divine purpose in the havoc around her, and
it is possible that some such euphemism attached to the attitude before
the Thug accepted it as his own benediction from this highly decorated
personage of human cruelty.</p>
<p>The ancient reverence for Kali has gradually passed to her mitigated
form&mdash;Durg&aacute;. Around her too are visible the symbols of
destruction; but she is supposed to be satisfied with pumpkin-animals,
and the weapons in her ten hands are believed to be directed against
the enemies of the gods, especially against the giant king Muheshu. She
is mother of the beautiful boy Kartik, and of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb279" href="#v1pb279" name=
"v1pb279">279</a>]</span>elephant-headed inspirer of knowledge Ganesa.
She is reverenced now as female energy, the bestower of beauty and
fruitfulness on women.</p>
<p>The identity of war-gods and death-demons, in the most frightful
conceptions which have haunted the human imagination, is of profound
significance. These forms do not represent peaceful and natural death,
not death by old age,&mdash;of which, alas, those who cowered before
them knew but little,&mdash;but death amid cruelty and agony, and the
cutting down of men in the vigour of life. That indeed was
terrible,&mdash;even more than these rude images could describe.</p>
<p>But there are other details in these hideous forms. The priest has
added to the horse and sword of war the adored serpent, and hideous
symbols of the &lsquo;Land of the Dead.&rsquo; For it is not by terror
of death, but of what he can persuade men lies beyond, that the priest
has reigned over mankind. When Isabel (in &lsquo;Measure for
Measure&rsquo;) is trying to persuade her brother that the sense of
death lies most in apprehension, the sentenced youth still finds death
&lsquo;a fearful thing.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="line">That flesh is heir to,&mdash;&rsquo;tis a

<p class="line">Devoutly to be wished.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The greater part of the human race still belong to
religions which, in their origin, promised eternal repose as the
supreme final bliss. Had death in itself possessed horrors for the
human mind, the priest need not have conjured up beyond it those
tortures that haunted Hamlet with the dreams of possible evils beyond
which make even the wretched rather bear the ills they have than fly to
others they know not of. It would have been sufficient sanction to
promise immortality only to the pious. But as in Claudio&rsquo;s
shuddering lines every hell is reflected&mdash;whether of ice, fire, or
brutalisation&mdash;so are the same mixed with the very blood and brain
of mankind, even where literally outgrown. Christianity superadded to
the horrors by importing the idea that death came by human sin, and so
by gradual development ascribing to Satan the power of death; thereby
forming a new devil who bore in him the power to make death a
punishment. How the matter stood in the medi&aelig;val belief may be
seen in figure 19, copied from a Russian Bible of the (early)
seventeenth century. Lazarus smiles to see the nondescript soul of
Dives torn from him by a devil with a hook, while another drowns the
groans with a drum. Satan squirts an infernal baptism on the departing
soul, and the earnest co-operation of the archangel justifies the
satisfaction of Lazarus and Abraham. This degraded belief is still
found in the almost gleeful pulpit-picturings of physical agonies as
especially attending the death-beds of &lsquo;infidels,&rsquo;&mdash;as
Voltaire and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb281" href="#v1pb281"
name="v1pb281">281</a>]</span>Paine,&mdash;and its fearful result is
found in the degree to which priesthoods are still able to paralyse the
common sense and heart of the masses by the barbaric ceremonials with
which they are permitted to surround death, and the arrogant line drawn
between unorthodox goats and credulous sheep by
&lsquo;consecrated&rsquo; ground.</p>

suggested that the youthful winged figure on the drum of a column from
the temple of Diana at Ephesus to the British Museum, may be a
representation of Thanatos, Death. It would be agreeable to believe
that the only important representation of Death left by Greek art is
that exquisite figure, whose high tribute is that it was at first
thought to be Love! The figure is somewhat like the tender Eros of
preraphaelite art, and with the same look of gentle melancholy. Such a
sweet and simple form of Death would be worthy of the race which, amid
all the fiery or cold rivers of the underworld which had gathered about
their religion, still saw running there the soft-flowing stream of
forgetfulness. Let one study this Ephesian Thanatos reverently&mdash;no
engraving or photograph can do it even partial justice&mdash;and then
in its light read those myths of Death which seem to bear us back
beyond the savagery of war and the artifices of priests to the simpler
conceptions of humanity. In its serene light we may especially read
both Vedic and Iranian hymns and legends of Yama.</p>
<p>The first man to die became the powerful Yama of the Hindus, the
monarch of the dead; and he became invested with metaphors of the sun
that had set.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5878src" href="#xd20e5878"

<p>Such was the Iranian Yima. He was that &lsquo;<span lang="la">flos
regum</span>&rsquo; whose reign represented &lsquo;the ideal of human
happiness, when there was neither illness nor death, neither heat nor
cold,&rsquo; and who has never died. &lsquo;According to the earlier
traditions of the <i>Avesta</i>,&rsquo; says Spiegel, &lsquo;Jima does
not die, but when evil and misery began to prevail on earth, retires to
a smaller space, a kind of garden or Eden, where he continues his happy
life with those who remained true to him.&rsquo; Such have been the
antecedents of our many beautiful myths which ascribe even an earthly
immortality to the great,&mdash;to Barbarossa, Arthur, and even to the
heroes of humbler races as Hiawatha and Glooscap of North American
tribes,&mdash;who are or were long believed to have &lsquo;sailed into
the fiery sunset,&rsquo; or sought some fair island, or to slumber in a
hidden grotto, until the world shall have grown up to their stature and
requires their return.</p>
<p>In Japan the (Sintoo) god of Hell is now named Amma, and one may
suspect that it is some imitation of Yama by reason of the majesty he
still retains in the popular conception. He is pictured as a grave man,
wearing a judicial cap, and no cruelties seem to be attributed to him
personally, but only to the <i>oni</i> or demons of whom he is
lord.</p>
<p>The kindly characteristics of the Hindu Yama seem in Persia to have
been replaced by the bitterness of Ahriman, or Anra-mainyu, the genius
of evil. Haug interprets Anra-mainyu as &lsquo;Death-darting.&rsquo;
The word is the counterpart of Spe&ntilde;ta-mainyu, and means
originally the &lsquo;throttling spirit;&rsquo; being thus from
<i>anh</i>, philologically the root of all evil, as we shall see when
we consider its dragon brood. Professor Whitney translates the name
&lsquo;Malevolent.&rsquo; But, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb284"
href="#v1pb284" name="v1pb284">284</a>]</span>whatever may be the
meaning of the word, there is little doubt that the Twins of Vedic
Mythology&mdash;Yama and Yami&mdash;parted into genii of Day and Night,
and were ultimately spiritualised in the Spirit of Light and Spirit of
Darkness which have made the basis of all popular theology from the
time of Zoroaster until this day.</p>
<p>Nothing can be more remarkable than the extreme difference between
the ancient Hindu and the Persian view of death. As to the former it
was the happy introduction to Yama, to the latter it was the visible
seal of Ahriman&rsquo;s equality with Ormuzd. They held it in absolute
horror. The Towers of Silence stand in India to-day as monuments of
this darkest phase of the Pars&icirc; belief. The dead body belonged to
Ahriman, and was left to be devoured by wild creatures; and although
the raising of towers for the exposure of the corpse, so limiting its
consumption to birds, has probably resulted from a gradual rationalism
which has from time to time suggested that by such means souls of the
good may wing their way to Ormuzd, yet the Pars&icirc; horror of death
is strong enough to give rise to such terrible suspicions, even if they
were unfounded, as those which surrounded the Tower (Khao&rsquo;s
Dokhma) in June 1877. The strange behaviour of the corpse-bearers in
leaving one tower, going to another, and afterwards (as was said)
secretly repairing to the first, excited the belief that a man had been
found alive in the first and was afterwards murdered. The story seems
to have begun with certain young Pars&icirc;s themselves, and, whether
it be true or not, they have undoubtedly interpreted rightly the
ancient feeling of that sect with regard to all that had been within
the kingdom of the King of Terrors. &lsquo;As sickness and
death,&rsquo; says Professor Whitney, &lsquo;were supposed to be the
work of the malignant powers, the dead body itself was regarded with
superstitious horror. It had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb285"
href="#v1pb285" name="v1pb285">285</a>]</span>been gotten by the demons
into their own peculiar possession, and became a chief medium through
which they exercised their defiling action upon the living. Everything
that came into its neighbourhood was unclean, and to a certain extent
exposed to the influences of the malevolent spirits, until purified by
the ceremonies which the law prescribed.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e5915src" href="#xd20e5915" name="xd20e5915src">7</a> It is to be
feared this notion has crept in among the Brahmans; the <i>Indian
Mirror</i> (May 26, 1878) states that a Chandernagore lady, thrown into
the Ganges, but afterwards found to be alive, was believed to be
possessed by Dano (an evil spirit), and but for interference would have
found a watery grave. The Jews also were influenced by this belief, and
to this day it is forbidden a Cohen, or descendant of the priesthood,
to touch a dead body.</p>
<p>The audience at the Crystal Palace which recently witnessed the
performance of Euripides&rsquo; <i>Alcestis</i> could hardly, it is to
be feared, have realised the relation of the drama to their own
religion. Apollo induces the Fates to consent that Admetus shall not
die provided he can find a substitute for him. The pure Alcestis steps
forward and devotes herself to death to save her husband. Apollo tries
to persuade Death to give back Alcestis, but Death declares her fate
demanded by justice. While Alcestis is dying, Admetus bids her entreat
the gods for pity; but Alcestis says it is a god who has brought on the
necessity, and adds, &lsquo;Be it so!&rsquo; She sees the hall of the
dead, with &lsquo;the winged Pluto staring from beneath his black
eyebrows.&rsquo; She reminds her husband of the palace and regal sway
she might have enjoyed in Thessaly had she not left it for him.
Bitterly does Pheres reproach Admetus for accepting life through the
vicarious suffering and death of another. Then comes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb286" href="#v1pb286" name=
"v1pb286">286</a>]</span>Hercules; he vanquishes Death; he leads forth
Alcestis from &lsquo;beneath into the light.&rsquo; With her he comes
into the presence of Admetus, who is still in grief. Admetus cannot
recognise her; but when he recognises her with joy, Hercules warns him
that it is not lawful for Alcestis to address him &lsquo;until she is
unbound from her consecration to the gods beneath, and <i>the third day
come</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It only requires a change of names to make Alcestis a Passion-play.
The unappeasable Justice which is as a Fate binding the deity, though
it may be satisfied vicariously; &lsquo;the last enemy, Death;&rsquo;
the atonement by sacrifice of a saintly human being, who from a
father&rsquo;s palace is brought by love freely to submit to death; the
son of a god (Zeus) by a human mother (Alcmene),&mdash;the god-man
Herakles,&mdash;commissioned to destroy earthly evils by twelve great
labours,&mdash;descending to conquer Death and deliver one of the
&lsquo;spirits in prison,&rsquo; the risen spirit not recognised at
first, as Jesus was not by Mary; still bearing the consecration of the
grave until the third day, which forbade intercourse with the living
(&lsquo;Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my
Father&rsquo;),&mdash;all these enable us to recognise in the theologic
edifices around us the fragments of a crumbled superstition as they lay
around Euripides.</p>
<p>From the old pictures of Christ&rsquo;s triumphal pilgrimage on
earth parallels for the chief Labours of Herakles may be found; he is
shown treading on the lion, asp, dragon, and Satan; but the myths
converge in the Descent into Hades and the conquest of Death. It is
remarkable that in the old pictures of Christ delivering souls from
Hades he is generally represented closely followed by Eve, whose form
so emerging would once have been to the greater part of Europe already
familiar as that of either Alcestis, Eurydice, or Persephone. One of
the earliest examples <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb287" href=
"#v1pb287" name="v1pb287">287</a>]</span>of the familiar subject,
Christ conquering Death, is that in the ancient (tenth century) Missal
of Worms,&mdash;that city whose very name preserves the record of the
same combat under the guise of Siegfried and the Worm, or Dragon. The
cross is now the sword thrust near the monster&rsquo;s mouth. The
picture illustrates the chant of Holy Week: &lsquo;<span lang="la">De
manu Mortis liberabo eos, de Morte redimam eos. Ero Mors tua, O Mors;
morsus tuus ero, inferne.</span>&rsquo; From the pierced mouth of Death
are vomited flames, which remind us of his ethnical origin; but it is
not likely that to the christianised pagans of Worms the picture could
ever have conveyed an impression so weirdly horrible as that of their
own goddess of Death, Hel. &lsquo;Her hall is called Elvidnir, realm of
the cold storm: Hunger is her table; Starvation, her knife; Delay, her
man; Slowness, her maid; Precipice, her threshold; Care, her bed;
burning Anguish, the hangings of her apartments. One half of her body
is livid, the other half the colour of human flesh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With the Scandinavian picture of the Abode of Death may be compared
the description of the Abode of Nin-ki-gal, the Assyrian Queen of
Death, from a tablet in the British Museum, translated by Mr. Fox
Talbot:<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5942src" href="#xd20e5942" name=

<div class="lgouter">

<p class="line">Light is not seen; in darkness they dwell:</p>
<p class="line">Ghosts, like birds, flutter their wings there;</p>
<p class="line">On the door and the gate-posts the dust lies

</div>
<p class="first">The Semitic tribes, undisturbed, like the importers of
their theology into the age of science, by the strata in which so many
perished animal kingdoms are entombed, attributed all death, even that
of animals, to the forbidden <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb288"
href="#v1pb288" name="v1pb288">288</a>]</span>fruit. The Rabbins say
that not only Adam and Eve, but the animals in Eden, partook of that
fruit, and came under the power of Samma&euml;l the Violent, and of his
agent Azra&euml;l, the demon of Death. The Ph&oelig;nix, having refused
this food, preserved the power of renovating itself.</p>
<p>It is an example of the completeness and consistency with which a
theory may organise its myth, that the fatal demons are generally
represented as abhorring salt&mdash;the preserving agent and foe of
decay. The &lsquo;Covenant of Salt&rsquo; among the ancient Jews
probably had this significance, and the care with which Job salted his
sacrifice is considered elsewhere. Aubrey says, &lsquo;Toads (Saturnine
animals) are killed by putting salt upon them. I have seen the
experiment.&rsquo; The devil, as heir of death-demons, appears in all
European folklore as a hater of salt. A legend, told by Heine, relates
that a knight, wandering in a wood in Italy, came upon a ruin, and in
it a wondrous statue of the goddess of Beauty. Completely fascinated,
the knight haunted the spot day after day, until one evening he was met
by a servant who invited him to enter a villa which he had not before
remarked. What was his surprise to be ushered into the presence of the
living image of his adored statue! Amid splendour and flowers the
enraptured knight is presently seated with his charmer at a banquet.
Every luxury of the world is there; but there is no salt! When he hints
this want a cloud passes over the face of his Beauty. Presently he asks
the servant to bring the salt; the servant does so, shuddering; the
knight helps himself to it. The next sip of wine he takes elicits a cry
from him: it is liquid fire. Madness seizes upon him; caresses, burning
kisses follow, until he falls asleep on the bosom of his goddess. But
what visions! Now he sees her as a wrinkled crone, next a great bat
bearing a torch as it flutters around him, and again as a frightful
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb289" href="#v1pb289" name=
"v1pb289">289</a>]</span>monster, whose head he cuts off in an agony of
terror. When the knight awakes it is in his own villa. He hastens to
his ruin, and to the beloved statue; he finds her fallen from the
pedestal, and the beautiful head cut from the neck lying at her
feet.</p>
<p>The Semitic Angel of Death is a figure very different from any that
we have considered. He is known in theology only in the degradation
which he suffered at the hands of the Rabbins, but originally was an
awful but by no means evil genius. The Persians probably imported him,
under the name of Asuman, for we do not find him mentioned in their
earlier books, and the name has a resemblance to the Hebrew
<i>shamad</i>, to exterminate, which would connect it with the biblical
&lsquo;destroyer&rsquo; Abaddon. This is rendered more probable because
the Zoroastrians believed in an earlier demon, V&iacute;zaresha, who
carried souls after death to the region of Deva-worshippers (India).
The Chaldaic Angel of Death, Malk-ad Mousa, may have derived his name
from the legend of his having approached Moses with the object of
forcing his soul out of his body, but, being struck by the glory of
Moses&rsquo; face, and by virtue of the divine name on his rod, was
compelled to retire. The legend is not so ancient as the name, and was
possibly a Saga suggested by the name; it is obviously the origin of
the tradition of the struggle between Michael and Satan for the body of
Moses (Jude 9.). This personification had thus declined among the Jews
into being evil enough to be identified with Sama&euml;l,&mdash;who, in
the Book of the Assumption of Moses, is named as his
assailant,&mdash;and subsequently with Satan himself, named in
connection with the New Testament version. It was on account of this
degradation of a being described in the earlier books of the Bible as
the commissioner of Jehovah that there was gradually developed among
the Jews two Angels of Death, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb290"
href="#v1pb290" name="v1pb290">290</a>]</span>one (Sama&euml;l, or his
agent Azra&euml;l) for those who died out of the land of Israel, and
the other (Gabriel) for those who had the happier lot of dying in their
own country.</p>
<p>This relegation of Sama&euml;l to the wandering Jews&mdash;who if
they died abroad were not supposed to reach Paradise with facility, if
at all&mdash;is significant. For Sama&euml;l is pretty certainly a
conception borrowed from outlying Semitic tribes. What that conception
was we find in Job xviii. 18, where he is &lsquo;the king of
Terrors,&rsquo; and still more in the Arabic Azra&euml;l. The legend of
this typical Angel of Death is that he was promoted to his high office
for special service. When Allah was about to create man he sent the
angels Gabriel, Michael, and Israfil to the earth to bring clay of
different colours for that purpose; but the Earth warned them that the
being about to be formed would rebel against his creator and draw down
a curse upon her (the Earth), and they returned without bringing the
clay. Then Azra&euml;l was sent by Allah, and he executed his
commission without fear; and for this he was appointed the angel to
separate souls from bodies. Azra&euml;l had subordinate angels under
him, and these are alluded to in the opening lines of the Sura 79 of
the Koran:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">By the angels who tear forth the souls of some with
violence;</p>
<p class="line">And by those who draw forth the souls of others with
gentleness.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The souls of the righteous are drawn forth with
gentleness, those of the wicked torn from them in the way shown in the
Russian picture (<a href="#v1fig19">Fig. 19</a>), which is indeed an
illustration of the same mythology.</p>
<p>These terrible tasks were indeed such as were only too likely to
bring Azra&euml;l into the evil repute of an executioner in the course
of time; but no degradation of him seems to have been developed among
the Moslems. He seems to have been associated in their minds with Fate,
and similar stories were told of him. Thus it is related that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb291" href="#v1pb291" name=
"v1pb291">291</a>]</span>once when Azra&euml;l was passing by Solomon
he gazed intently upon a man with whom Solomon was conversing. Solomon
told his companion that it was the Angel of Death who was looking at
him, and the man replied, &lsquo;He seems to want me: order the wind to
carry me from hence into India;&rsquo; when this was done Azra&euml;l
approached Solomon and said, &lsquo;I looked earnestly at that man from
wonder, for I was commanded to take his soul in India.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e5992src" href="#xd20e5992" name=
"xd20e5992src">9</a></p>
<p>Azra&euml;l was often represented as presenting to the lips a cup of
poison. It is probable that this image arose from the ancient ordeal by
poison, whereby draughts, however manipulated beforehand with reference
to the results, were popularly held to be divinely mingled for
retributive or beneficent effects. &lsquo;Cup&rsquo; thus became among
Semitic tribes a symbol of Fate. The &lsquo;cup of consolation,&rsquo;
&lsquo;cup of wrath,&rsquo; &lsquo;cup of trembling,&rsquo; which we
read of in the Old Testament; the &lsquo;cup of blessing,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;cup of devils,&rsquo; spoken of by Paul, have this significance.
The cup of Nestor, ornamented with the dove (Iliad, xi. 632), was
probably a &lsquo;cup of blessing,&rsquo; and Mr. Schliemann has found
several of the same kind at Mycen&aelig;. The symbol was repeatedly
used by Christ,&mdash;&lsquo;Let this cup pass from me,&rsquo;
&lsquo;The cup that my Father hath given me to drink shall I not drink
it,&rsquo; &lsquo;Are ye able to drink of the cup that I drink
of,&rsquo;&mdash;and the familiar association of Azra&euml;l&rsquo;s
cup is expressed in the phrase &lsquo;taste of death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One of the most pleasing modifications of the belief in the Angel of
Death is that found by Lepsius<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5999src"
href="#xd20e5999" name="xd20e5999src">10</a> among the Mohammedan
negroes of Kordofan. Osra&icirc;n (Azra&euml;l), it is said, receives
the souls of the dead, and leads the good to their reward, the bad to
punishment. &lsquo;He lives in a tree, el segerat mohana (the tree of
fulfilling), which has as many <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb292"
href="#v1pb292" name="v1pb292">292</a>]</span>leaves as there are
inhabitants in the world. On each leaf is a name, and when a child is
born a new one grows. If any one becomes ill his leaf fades, and should
he be destined to die, Osra&icirc;n breaks it off. Formerly he used to
come visibly to those whom he was going to carry away, and thus put
them in great terror. Since the prophet&rsquo;s time, however, he has
become invisible; for when he came to fetch Mohammed&rsquo;s soul he
told him that it was not good that by his visible appearance he should
frighten mankind. They might then easily die of terror, before praying;
for he himself, although a courageous and spirited man, was somewhat
perturbed at his appearance. Therefore the prophet begged God to make
Osra&icirc;n invisible, which prayer was granted.&rsquo; Mr. Mackenzie
adds on this that, among the Moravian Jews, at new moon a branch is
held in its light, and the name of a person pronounced: his face will
appear between the horns of the moon, and should he be destined to die
the leaves will fade.</p>

</div>
<p>Mr. John Ruskin has been very severe upon the Italians for the
humour with which they introduce Death as a person of their masque.
&lsquo;When I was in Venice in 1850,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;the most
popular piece of the <i>comic</i> opera was &ldquo;Death and the
Cobbler,&rdquo; in which the point of the plot was the success of a
village cobbler as a physician, in consequence of the appearance of
Death to him beside the bed of every patient who was not to recover;
and the most applauded scene in it was one in which the physician,
insolent in success, and swollen with luxury, was himself taken down
into the abode of Death, and thrown into an agony of terror by being
shown lives of men, under the form of wasting lamps, and his own ready
to expire.&rsquo; On which he expresses the opinion that &lsquo;this
endurance of fearful images is partly associated with indecency, partly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb293" href="#v1pb293" name=
"v1pb293">293</a>]</span>with general fatuity and weakness of
mind.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6018src" href="#xd20e6018"
name="xd20e6018src">11</a> But may it not rather be the healthy
reaction from morbid images of terror, with which a purely natural and
inevitable event has so long been invested by priests, and portrayed in
such popular pictures as &lsquo;The Dance of Death?&rsquo; The mocking
laughter with which the skeletons beset the knight in our picture
(<a href="#v1fig20">Fig. 20</a>), from the wall of La Chaise Dieu,
Auvergne, marks the priestly terrorism, which could not fail to be
vulgarised even more by the frivolous. In 1424 there was a masquerade
of the Dance of Death in the Cemetery of the Innocents at Paris,
attended by the Duke of Bedford and the Duke of Burgundy, just returned
from battle. It may have been the last outcome in the west of
Kali&rsquo;s dance over the slain; but it is fortunate when Fanaticism
has no worse outcome than Folly. The Skeleton Death <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb294" href="#v1pb294" name=
"v1pb294">294</a>]</span>has the advantage over earlier forms of
suggesting the naturalness of death. It is more scientific. The gradual
discovery by the people that death is not caused by sin has largely
dissipated its horrors in regions where the ignorance and impostures of
priestcraft are of daily observation; and although the reaction may not
be expressed with good taste, there would seem to be in it a certain
vigour of nature, reasserting itself in simplicity.</p>
<p>In the northern world we are all too sombre in the matter. It is the
ages of superstition which have moulded our brains, and too generally
given to our natural love of life the unnatural counterpart of a terror
of death. What has been artificially bred into us can be cultivated out
of us. There are indeed deaths corresponding to the two
Angels&mdash;the death that comes by lingering disease and pain, and
that which comes by old age. There are indeed Azra&euml;ls in our
cities who poison the food and drink of the people, and mingle death in
the cup of water; and of them there should be increasing horror until
the gentler angel abides with us, and death by old age becomes normal.
The departure from life being a natural condition of entering upon it,
it is melancholy indeed that it should be ideally confused with the
pains and sorrows often attending it. It is fabled that Menippus the
Cynic, travelling through Hades, knew which were the kings there by
their howling louder than the rest. They howled loudest because they
had parted from most pleasures on earth. But all the happy and young
have more reason to lament untimely death than kings. The only tragedy
of Death is the ruin of living Love. Mr. Watts, in his great picture of
Love and Death (Grosvenor Gallery, 1877), revealed the real horror. Not
that skeleton which has its right time and place, not the winged demon
(called angel), who has no right time or place, is here, but a huge,
hard, heartless <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb295" href="#v1pb295"
name="v1pb295">295</a>]</span>form, as of man half-blocked out of
marble; a terrible emblem of the remorseless force that embodies the
incompleteness and ignorance of mankind&mdash;a force that steadily
crushes hearts where intellects are devoting their energies to alien
worlds. Poor Love has little enough science; his puny arm stretched out
to resist the colossal form is weak as the prayers of agonised parents
and lovers directed against never-swerving laws; he is almost
exhausted; his lustrous wings are broken and torn in the struggle; the
dove at his feet crouches mateless; the rose that climbed on his door
is prostrate; over his shoulder the beam-like arm has set the stony
hand against the door where the rose of joy must fall.</p>
<p>The aged when they die do but follow the treasures that have gone
before. One by one the old friends have left them, the sweet ties
parted, and the powers to enjoy and help become feeble. When of the
garden that once bloomed around them memory alone is left, friendly is
death to scatter also the leaves of that last rose where the loved ones
are sleeping. This is the real office of death. Nay, even when it comes
to the young and happy it is not Death but Disease that is the real
enemy; in disease there is almost no compensation at all but learning
its art of war; but Death is Nature&rsquo;s pity for helpless pain;
where love and knowledge can do no more it comes as a release from
sufferings which were sheer torture if prolonged. The presence of death
is recognised oftenest by the cessation of pain. Superstition has done
few heavier wrongs to humanity than by the mysterious terrors with
which it has invested that change which, to the simpler ages, was
pictured as the gentle river Lethe, flowing from the abode of sleep,
from which the shades drank oblivion alike of their woes and of the
joys from which they were torn. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb297"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Having indicated, necessarily in mere outline and by
selected examples, the chief obstacles encountered by primitive man,
and his apprehensions, which he personified as demons, it becomes my
next task to show how and why many of these demons declined from their
terrible proportions and made way for more general forms, expressing
comparatively abstract conceptions of physical evil. This will involve
some review of the processes through which man&rsquo;s necessary
adaptation to his earthly environment brought him to the era of Combat
with multiform obstruction.</p>
<p>There was, until within a few recent years, in a mountain of
Travancore, India, an ancient, gigantic Tree, regarded by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb300" href="#v1pb300" name=
"v1pb300">300</a>]</span>the natives as the residence of a powerful and
dangerous deity who reigned over the mountains and the wild
beasts.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6058src" href="#xd20e6058" name=
"xd20e6058src">1</a> Sacrifices were offered to this tree, sermons
preached before it, and it seems to have been the ancient cathedral of
the district. Its trunk was so large that four men with outstretched
arms could not compass it.</p>
<p>This tree in its early growth may symbolise the upspringing of
natural religion. Its first green leaves may be regarded as
corresponding to the first crude imaginations of man as written, for
instance, on leaves of the Vedas. Perceiving in nature, as we have
seen, a power of contrivance like his own, a might far superior to his
own, man naturally considered that all things had been created and were
controlled by invisible giants; and bowing helplessly beneath them sang
thus his hymns and supplications.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This earth belongs to Varuna, the king, and the wide sky,
with its ends far apart: the two seas (sky and ocean) are
Varuna&rsquo;s loins; he is also contained in this drop of water. He
who would flee far beyond the sky even he would not be rid of Varuna.
His spies proceed from heaven towards this earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Through want of strength, thou ever strong and bright god,
have I gone wrong: have mercy, have mercy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;However we break thy laws from day to day, men as we are, O
god Varuna, do not deliver us to death!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was it an old sin, Varuna, that thou wished to destroy the
friend who always praises thee!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Indra, have mercy, give me my daily bread! Raise up wealth
to the worshipper, thou mighty Dawn!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou art the giver of horses, Indra, thou art the giver of
cows, the giver of corn, the strong lord of wealth: the old guide of
man disappointing no desires: to him we <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb301" href="#v1pb301" name="v1pb301">301</a>]</span>address this
song. All this wealth around here is known to be thine alone: take from
it conqueror, bring it hither!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In these characteristic sentences from various hymns we behold man
making his first contract with the ruling powers of nature: so much
adoration and flattery on his part for so much benefit on theirs. But
even in these earliest hymns there are intimations that the gods were
not fulfilling their side of the engagement. &lsquo;Why is it,&rsquo;
pleads the worshipper, &lsquo;that you wish to destroy one who always
praises you? Was it an old sin?&rsquo; The simple words unconsciously
report how faithfully man was performing his part of the contract.
Having omitted no accent of the prayer, praise, or ritual, he supposes
the continued indifference of the gods must be due to an old sin, one
he has forgotten, or perhaps one committed by some ancestor.</p>
<p>In this state of mind the suggestion would easily take root that
words alone were too cheap to be satisfactory to the gods. There must
be offerings. Like earthly kings they must have their revenues. We thus
advance to the phase of sacrifices. But still neither in answer to
prayer, flattery, or sacrifice did the masses receive health or wealth.
Poverty, famine, death, still continued their remorseless course with
the silent machinery of sun, moon, and star.</p>
<p>But why, then, should man have gone on fulfilling his part of the
contract&mdash;believing and worshipping deities, who when he begged
for corn gave him famine, and when he asked for fish gave him a
serpent? The priest intervened with ready explanation. And here we may
consult the holy Tree of Travancore again? Why should that particular
Tree&mdash;of a species common in the district and not usually very
large&mdash;have grown so huge? &lsquo;Because it is holy,&rsquo; said
the priest. &lsquo;Because it was believed holy,&rsquo; says the fact.
For ages the blood and ashes of victims fed its roots and swelled its
trunk; until, by an argument not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb302"
href="#v1pb302" name="v1pb302">302</a>]</span>confined to India, the
dimensions of the superstition were assumed to prove its truth. When
the people complained that all their offerings and worship did not
bring any returns the priest replied, You stint the gods and they stint
you. The people offered the fattest of their flocks and fruits: More
yet! said the priest. They built fine altars and temples for the gods:
More yet! said the priest. They built fine houses for the priests, and
taxed themselves to support them. And when thus, fed by popular
sacrifices and toils, the religion had grown to vast power, the priest
was able to call to his side the theologian for further explanation.
The theologian and the priest said&mdash;&lsquo;Of course there must be
good reasons why the gods do not answer all your prayers (if they did
not answer some you would be utterly consumed); mere mortals must not
dare to inquire into their mysteries; but that there are gods, and that
they do attend to human affairs, is made perfectly plain by this
magnificent array of temples, and by the care with which they have
supplied all the wants of us, their particular friends, whose cheeks,
as you see, hang down with fatness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If, after this explanation, any scepticism or rebellion arose among
the less favoured, the priest might easily
add&mdash;&lsquo;Furthermore, we and our temples are now institutions;
we are so strong and influential that it is evident that the gods have
appointed us to be their representatives on earth, the dispensers of
their favours. Also, of their disfavours. We are able to make up for
the seeming indifference of the gods, rewarding you if you give us
honour and wealth, but ruining you if you turn heretical.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So grew the holy Tree. But strong as it was there was something
stronger. Some few years ago a missionary from London went to
Travancore, and desired to build a chapel near the same tree, no doubt
to be in the way of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb303" href=
"#v1pb303" name="v1pb303">303</a>]</span>its worshippers and to borrow
some of the immemorial sanctity of the spot. This missionary fixed a
hungry eye upon that holy timber, and reflected how much holier it
would be if ending its career in the beams of a christian chapel. So
one day&mdash;English authorities being conveniently near&mdash;he and
his workmen began to cut down the sacred Tree. The natives gradually
gathered around, and looked on with horror. While the cutting proceeded
a tiger drew near, but shouts drove him off: the natives breathed
freer; the demon had come and looked on, but could not protect the Tree
from the Englishman. They still shuddered, however, at the sacrilege,
and when at last the Holy Tree of Travancore fell, its crash was
mingled with the cries and screams of its former worshippers. The
victorious missionary may be pointing out in his chapel the cut-up
planks which reveal the impotence of the deity so long feared by the
natives; and perhaps he is telling them of the bigness of <i>his</i>
Tree, and claiming its flourishing condition in Europe as proof of its
supernatural character. Possibly he may omit to mention the blood and
ashes which have fattened the root and enlarged the trunk of <i>his</i>
Holy Tree!</p>
<p>That Tree in Travancore could never have been so destroyed if the
primitive natural religion in which lay its deeper root had not
previously withered. The gods, the natural forces, which through so
many ages had not heeded man&rsquo;s daily martyrdoms, had now for a
long time been shown quite as impotent to protect their own shrines,
images, holy trees, and other interests. The priests as vainly invoked
those gods to save their own country from subjugation by other nations
with foreign gods, as the masses had invoked their personal aid. For a
long time the gods in some parts of India have received only a formal
service, coextensive with their association with a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb304" href="#v1pb304" name=
"v1pb304">304</a>]</span>lingering order, or as part of princely
establishments; but they topple down from time to time, as the masses
realise their freedom to abandon them with impunity. They are at the
mercy of any strong heretic who arises. The following narrative, quoted
by Mr. Herbert Spencer, presents a striking example of what some
Hindoos had been doing before the missionary cut down the Tree at
Travancore:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A Nepaul king, Rum Bah&acirc;dur, whose beautiful queen,
finding her lovely face had been disfigured by smallpox, poisoned
herself, cursed his kingdom, her doctors, and the gods of Nepaul,
vowing vengeance on all. Having ordered the doctors to be flogged, and
the right ear and nose of each to be cut off, he then wreaked his
vengeance on the gods of Nepaul, and after abusing them in the most
gross way, he accused them of having obtained from him 12,000 goats,
some hundred-weights of sweetmeats, 2000 gallons of milk, &amp;c.,
under false pretences. He then ordered all the artillery, varying from
three to twelve-pounders, to be brought in front of the palace. All the
guns were then loaded to the muzzle, and down he marched to the
headquarters of the Nepaul deities. All the guns were drawn up in front
of the several deities, honouring the most sacred with the heaviest
metal. When the order to fire was given, many of the chiefs and
soldiers ran away panic-stricken, and others hesitated to obey the
sacrilegious order; and not till several gunners had been cut down were
the guns opened. Down came the gods and the goddesses from their
hitherto sacred positions; and after six hours&rsquo; heavy
cannonading, not a vestige of the deities remained.&rsquo;</p>
<p>However panic-stricken the Nepaulese may have been at this ferocious
manifestation, it was but a storm bred out of a more general mental and
moral condition. Rum <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb305" href=
"#v1pb305" name="v1pb305">305</a>]</span>Bah&acirc;dur only laid low in
a few moments images of gods who, passing from the popular interest,
had been successively laid to sleep on the innumerable shelves of Hindu
mythology. The early Dualism was developed into Moral Man on one side,
and Unmoral Nature on the other. Man had discovered that moral order in
nature was represented solely by his own power: by his culture or
neglect the plant or animal grew or withered, and where his control did
not extend, there sprang the noxious weed or beast. So far as good gods
had been imagined they were respected now only as incarnate in men. But
the active powers of evil still remained, hurtful and hateful to man,
and the pessimist view of nature became inevitable. To man engaged in
his life-and-death struggle with nature many a beauty which now
nourishes the theist&rsquo;s optimism was lost. The fragrant flower was
a weed to the man hungry for bread, and he viewed many an idle treasure
with the disappointment of S&acirc;di when, travelling in the desert,
he found a bag in which he hoped to discover grain, but found only
pearls. Fatal to every deity not anthropomorphic was the long
pessimistic phase of human faith. Each became more purely a demon, and
passed on the road to become a devil.</p>
<p>Many particular demons man conquered as he progressively carried
order amid the ruggedness and wildness of his planet. Every new weapon
or implement he invented punctured a thousand phantoms. Only in the
realms he could not yet conquer remained the hostile forces to which he
ascribed pr&aelig;ternatural potency, because not able to pierce them
and see through them. Nevertheless, the early demonic forms had to give
way, for man had discovered that they were not his masters. He could
cut down the Upas and root up the nightshade; he had bruised many a
serpent&rsquo;s head and slain many a wolf. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb306" href="#v1pb306" name=
"v1pb306">306</a>]</span>In detail innumerable enemies had been proved
his inferiors in strength and intelligence. Important migrations took
place: man passes, geographically, away from the region of some of his
worst enemies, inhabits countries more fruitful, less malarious, his
habitat exceeding that of his animal foe in range; and, still better,
he passes by mental migration out of the stone age, out of other
helpless ages, to the age of metal and the skill to fashion and use it.
He has made the fire-fiend his friend. No longer henceforth a naked
savage, with bit of stone or bone only to meet the crushing powers of
the world and win its reluctant supplies!</p>
<p>There is a sense far profounder than its charming play of fancy in
Heine&rsquo;s account of the &lsquo;Gods in Exile,&rsquo; an essay
which Mr. Pater well describes as &lsquo;full of that strange blending
of sentiment which is characteristic of the traditions of the Middle
Age concerning the Pagan religions.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e6114src" href="#xd20e6114" name="xd20e6114src">2</a> Heine
writes: &lsquo;Let me briefly remind the reader how the gods of the
older world, at the time of the definite triumph of Christianity, that
is, in the third century, fell into painful embarrassments, which
greatly resembled certain tragical situations of their earlier life.
They now found themselves exposed to the same troublesome necessities
to which they had once before been exposed during the primitive ages,
in that revolutionary epoch when the Titans broke out of the custody of
Orcus, and, piling Pelion on Ossa, scaled Olympus. Unfortunate gods!
They had, then, to take flight ignominiously, and hide themselves among
us here on earth under all sorts of disguises. Most of them betook
themselves to Egypt, where for greater security they assumed the form
of animals, as is generally known. Just in the same way they had to
take flight again, and seek entertainment in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb307" href="#v1pb307" name=
"v1pb307">307</a>]</span>remote hiding-places, when those iconoclastic
zealots, the black brood of monks, broke down all the temples, and
pursued the gods with fire and curses. Many of these unfortunate
emigrants, entirely deprived of shelter and ambrosia, had now to take
to vulgar handicrafts as a means of earning their bread. In these
circumstances, many, whose sacred groves had been confiscated, let
themselves out for hire as wood-cutters in Germany, and had to drink
beer instead of nectar. Apollo seems to have been content to take
service under graziers, and as he had once kept the cows of Admetus, so
he lived now as a shepherd in Lower Austria. Here, however, having
become suspected, on account of his beautiful singing, he was
recognised by a learned monk as one of the old pagan gods, and handed
over to the spiritual tribunal. On the rack he confessed that he was
the god Apollo; and before his execution he begged that he might be
suffered to play once more upon the lyre and to sing a song. And he
played so touchingly, and sang with such magic, and was withal so
beautiful in form and feature that all the women wept, and many of them
were so deeply impressed that they shortly afterwards fell sick. And
some time afterwards the people wished to drag him from the grave
again, that a stake might be driven through his body, in the belief
that he had been a vampire, and that the sick women would by this means
recover. But they found the grave empty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Naturally: it is hard to bury Apollo. The next time he appeared was,
no doubt, as musical director in the nearest cathedral. The young
singers and artists discovered by such severe lessons that it was
dangerous to sing Pagan ballads too realistically; that a cowl is
capable of a high degree of decoration; that Pan&rsquo;s pipe sounds
well evolved into an organ; that Cupids look just as well if called
Cherubs. It is odd that it should have required Robert <span class=

<p class="first">So in one direction grew the hermitage to the Vatican;
so Zeus regained his throne by exchanging his thunderbolts for
Peter&rsquo;s keys, and Mars regained his steed as St. George, and
Hercules as Christ wrestles with Death once more. But while these
artificial restorations were going on in one direction, in another some
of the gods were passing through many countries, outwitting and
demolishing their former selves as lowered to demons. There are many
legends which report this strange phase of development, one of the
finest being that of The Goban Saor, told by Mr. Kennedy. The King of
Munster sent for this wonderful craftsman to build him a castle. The
Goban could fashion a spear with three strokes of his hammer&mdash;St.
Patrick, who found the Trinity in the shamrock, may have determined the
number of strokes,&mdash;and when he wished to drive in nails high up,
had only to throw his hammer at them. On his way to work for the King,
Goban, accompanied by his son, passed the night at the house of a
farmer, whose daughters&mdash;one dark and industrious, the other fair
and idle&mdash;received from him (Goban) three bits of advice:
&lsquo;Always have the head of an old woman by the hob; warm yourselves
with your work in the morning; and some time before I come back take
the skin of a newly-killed sheep to the market, and bring itself and
the price of it home again.&rsquo; As Goban, with his son, journeyed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb309" href="#v1pb309" name=
"v1pb309">309</a>]</span>on, they found a poor man vainly trying to
roof his house with three joists and mud; and by simply making one end
of each joist rest on the middle of another, the other ends being on
the wall, the structure was perfect. He relieved puzzled carpenters by
putting up for them the pegless and nailless bridge described in
C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s Commentaries. Having done various great things,
Goban returns to the homestead of the girls who had received his three
bits of advice. The idle one had, of course, blundered at each point,
and been ridiculed in the market for her proposition to bring back the
sheep&rsquo;s skin and its price. The other, by kindly taking in an
aged female relative, by working till she was warm, and by plucking and
selling the wool of the sheep&rsquo;s skin and bringing home the
latter, had obeyed the Goban&rsquo;s advice, and was selected as his
daughter-in-law&mdash;the prince attending the wedding. Now, as to
building the castle, Goban knew that the King had employed on previous
castles four architects and then slain them, so that they should never
build another palace equal to his. He therefore says he has left at
home a necessary implement which his wife will only give to himself or
one of royal blood. The King sends his son, who is kept as hostage till
the husband&rsquo;s safe return.</p>
<p>This is the Master Smith of Norse fable, who has a chair from which
none can rise, and who therein binds the devil; which again is the
story of Hephaistos, and the chair in which he entrapped Hera until she
revealed the secret of his birth. The &lsquo;devil&rsquo; whom the
Master Smith entraps is, in Norse mythology, simply Loki: and as Loki
is a degraded Hephaistos, fire in its demonic forms, we have in all
these legends the fire-fiend fought with fire.</p>
<p>This re-dualisation of the gods into demonic and saintly forms had a
long preparation. The forces that brought it about may be seen already
beginning in Hesiod&rsquo;s representations <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb310" href="#v1pb310" name=
"v1pb310">310</a>]</span>of the gods, in their presentation on the
stage by Euripides, in a manner certain to demonise them to the vulgar,
and to subject them to such laughter among scholars as still rings
across the ages in the divine dialogues of Lucian. What the gods had
become to the Lucians before they reached the Heines may be gathered
from the accompanying caricature (<a href="#v1fig21">Fig.
21</a>).<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6152src" href="#xd20e6152" name=
"xd20e6152src">3</a> Nothing can be more curious than the encounters of
the gods with their dead selves, their Manes. What unconscious
ingenuity in the combinations! St. Martin on his grey steed divides
with the beggar the cloud-cloak of Wodan on his black horse, treading
down just such paupers in his wild hunt; as saint he now shelters those
whom as storm-demon he chilled; but the identity of Junker Martin is
preserved in both titles and myths, and the Martinhorns (cakes),
twisted after fashion of the horns of goat or buck pursued by Wodan,
are deemed potent like horse-shoes to defend house or stable from the
outlawed god.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6190src" href="#xd20e6190"

</div>
<p>The more impressive and attractive myths transferred to christian
saints&mdash;as the flowers sacred to Freyja became Our
Lady&rsquo;s-glove, or slipper, or smock&mdash;there remained to the
old gods, in their own name, only the repulsive and puerile, and by
this means they were doomed at once to become unmitigated knaves and
fools. If Titans, J&ouml;tunn or Jinni, they were giant humbugs, whom
any small Hans or Jack might outwit and behead. Our Fairy lore is full
of stories which show that in the North as well as in Latin countries
there had already been a long preparation for the contempt poured by
Christianity upon the Norse deities. Many of the stories, as they now
stand in Folktales, speak of the vanquished demon or giant as the
devil, but it is perfectly easy to detach the being meant from the name
so indiscriminately bestowed by christian priests upon most of the
outlawed deities. In Lithuania, where survived too much reverence for
some of the earlier deities to admit <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb312" href="#v1pb312" name="v1pb312">312</a>]</span>of their being
identified with the devil, we still find them triumphed over by the wit
and skill of the artisan. Such is the case in a favourite popular
legend of that country in which Perkunas&mdash;the ancient Thunder-god,
corresponding to Perun in Russia&mdash;is involved in disgrace along
with the devil by the sagacity and skill of a carpenter. The aged god,
the venerable Devil, and the young Carpenter, united for a journey.
Perkun kept the beasts off with thunder and lightning, the Devil hunted
up food, the Carpenter cooked. At length they built a hut and lived in
it, and planted the ground with vegetables. Presently a thief invaded
their garden. Perkun and the Devil successively tried to catch him, but
were well thrashed; whereas the Carpenter by playing the fiddle
fascinated the thief, who was a witch, a hag whose hand the fiddler
managed to get into a split tree (under pretence of giving her a music
lesson), holding her there till she gave up her iron waggon and the
whip which she had used on his comrades. After this the three, having
decided to separate, disputed as to which should have the hut; and they
finally agreed that it should be the possession of him who should
succeed in frightening the two others. The Devil raised a storm which
frightened Perkun, and Perkun with his thunder and lightning frightened
the Devil; but the Carpenter held out bravely, and, in the middle of
the night, came in with the witch&rsquo;s waggon, and, cracking her
whip, the Devil and Perkun both took flight, leaving the Carpenter in
possession of the hut.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6208src" href=
"#xd20e6208" name="xd20e6208src">5</a></p>
<p>So far as Perkun is concerned, and may be regarded as representative
of the gods, the hut may be symbol of Europe, and the Carpenter type of
the power which conquered all that was left of them after their fair or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb313" href="#v1pb313" name=
"v1pb313">313</a>]</span>noble associations had been transferred to
christian forms. Somewhat later, the devil was involved in a like fate,
as we shall have to consider in a future chapter.</p>
<p>The most horrible superstitions, if tracked in their popular
development, reveal with special impressiveness the progressive
emancipation of man from the phantasms of ferocity which represented
his primal helplessness. The universal werewolf superstition, for
instance, drew its unspeakable horrors from deep and wide-spreading
roots. Originating, probably, in occasional relapses to cannibalism
among tribes or villages which found themselves amid circumstances as
urgent as those which sometimes lead a wrecked crew to draw lots which
shall die to support the rest, it would necessarily become demonised by
the necessity of surrounding cannibalism with dangers worse than
starvation. But it would seem that individuals are always liable, by
arrest of development which usually takes the form of disease or
insanity, to be dragged back to the savage condition of their race. In
the course of this dark history, we note first an increasing tendency
to show the means of the transformation difficult. In the <i>Volsunga
Saga</i> it is by simply putting on a &lsquo;wolf-shirt&rsquo;
(wolfskin) that a man may become a wolf. Then it is said it is done by
a belt made of the skin of a man who has been hung&mdash;all executed
persons being sacred to Wodan (because not dying a natural death), to
whom also the wolf was sacred. Then it is added, that the belt must be
marked with the signs of the zodiac, and have a buckle with seven
teeth. Then it is said that &lsquo;only a seventh son&rsquo; is
possessed of this diabolical power; or others say one whose brows meet
over his nose. The means of detecting werewolves and retransforming
them to human shape multiplied as those of transformation diminished in
number, and such remedies reflected the advance of human <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb314" href="#v1pb314" name=
"v1pb314">314</a>]</span>skill. The werewolf could be restored by
crossing his path with a knife or polished steel; by a sword laid on
the ground with point towards him; by a silver ball. Human skill was
too much for him. In Posen mothers had discovered that one who had
bread in his or her mouth could by even such means discover werewolves;
and fathers, to this hint about keeping &lsquo;the wolf from the
door,&rsquo; added that no one could be attacked by any such monster if
he were in a cornfield. The Slav levelled a plough at him. Thus by one
prescription and another, and each representing a part of man&rsquo;s
victory over chaos, the werewolf was driven out of all but a few
&lsquo;unlucky&rsquo; days in the year, and especially found his last
refuge in Twelfth Night. But even on that night the werewolf might be
generally escaped by the simple device of not speaking of him. If a
wolf had to be spoken of he was then called Vermin, and Dr. Wuttke
mentions a parish priest named Wolf in East Prussia who on Twelfth
Night was addressed as Mr. Vermin! The actual wolf being already out of
the forests in most places by art of the builder and the architect; the
phantasmal wolf driven out of fear for most of the year by man&rsquo;s
recognition of his own superiority to this exterminated beast; even the
proverbial &lsquo;ears&rsquo; of the vanishing werewolf ceased to be
visible when on his particular fest-night his name was not
mentioned.</p>
<p>The last execution of a man for being an occasional werewolf was, I
believe, in 1589, near Cologne, there being some evidence of
cannibalism. But nine years later, in France, where the belief in the
<i>Loup-garou</i> had been intense, a man so accused was simply shut up
in a mad-house. It is an indication of the revolution which has
occurred, that when next governments paid attention to werewolves it
was because certain vagabonds went about professing to be able to
transform themselves into wolves, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb315" href="#v1pb315" name="v1pb315">315</a>]</span>in order to
extort money from the more weak-minded and ignorant peasants.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e6232src" href="#xd20e6232" name="xd20e6232src">6</a>
There could hardly be conceived a more significant history: the
werewolf leaves where he entered. Of ignorance and weakness trying, too
often in vain, &lsquo;to keep the wolf from the door,&rsquo; was born
this voracious phantom; with the beggar and vagabond, survivals of
helplessness become inveterate, he wanders thin and crafty. He keeps
out of the way of all culture, whether of field or mind. So is it
indeed with all demons in decline&mdash;of which I can here only adduce
a few characteristic examples. So runs the rune&mdash;</p>

Croft</i>, is derived from the ancient belief that unless some wild
place is left to the sylvan spirits they will injure the grain and
vegetables; and, no doubt, some such notion leads the farmers of
Thurgau still to graft mistletoe upon their fruit-trees. Many who can
smile at such customs do yet preserve in their own minds, or those of
their servants or neighbours, crofts which the ploughshare of science
is forbidden to touch, and where the pr&aelig;ternatural troops still
hide their shrivelled forms. But this wild girdle becomes ever
narrower, and the images within it tend to blend with rustling leaf and
straw, and the insects, and to be otherwise invisible, save to that
second sight which is received from Glam. As in some shadow-pantomime,
the deities and demons pursue each other in endless procession,

Volcanoes, Icebergs, Deserts, though they might be&mdash;by growing

Concerning which Mr. Wright says: &lsquo;It is taken from an oxybaphon
which was brought from the Continent to England, where it passed into
the collection of Mr. William Hope.... The Hyperborean Apollo himself
appears as a quack-doctor, on his temporary stage, covered by a sort of
roof, and approached by wooden steps. On the stage lies Apollo&rsquo;s
luggage, consisting of a bag, a bow, and his Scythian cap. Chiron
(<span class="trans" title="ChIR&#332;N"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&Chi;&Iota;&Rho;&Omega;&Nu;</span></span>) is represented as
labouring under the effects of age and blindness, and supporting
himself by the aid of a crooked staff, as he repairs to the Delphian
quack-doctor for relief. The figure of the centaur is made to ascend by
the aid of a companion, both being furnished with the masks and other
attributes of the comic performers. Above are the mountains, and on
them the nymphs of Parnassus (<span class="trans" title=
"NYMPhAI"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&Nu;&Upsilon;&Mu;&Phi;&Alpha;&Iota;</span></span>), who, like all
the other actors in the scene, are disguised with masks, and those of a
very gross character.... Even a pun is employed to heighten the
drollery of the scene, for instead of <span class="trans" title=

consoler.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;History of Caricature,&rsquo; p. 18. But
who is the leaf-crowned figure, without mask, on the right hand? Was it
some early Offenbach, who found such representation of the gods welcome
at Athens where the attempt to produce our modern Offenbach&rsquo;s

latter kind of hungry werewolf a specimen still occasionally revisits
the glimpses of the moonshine which, for too many minds, still replaces
daylight. So recently as January 17, 1878, one Kate Bedwell, a
&lsquo;pedlar,<a id="xd20e6234" name="xd20e6234"></a> was sentenced in
the Marylebone Police Court, London, to three months&rsquo; hard labour
for obtaining various sums of money, amounting to 9s. 10d., by
terrorism, from Eliza Rolf, a cook. The pedlar came to the
plaintiff&rsquo;s place of work and asked her if she would like to have
her fortune told. Eliza replied, &lsquo;No, I know it; it is hard work
or starving.&rsquo; The fortune-teller asked her next time if she would
have her planet ruled; the other still said no; but her nerves yielded
when the &lsquo;Drud&rsquo; told her &lsquo;she lived under three
stars, one good the others bad, and that she could disfigure her or
turn her into something else.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thank God, she did
not!&rsquo; exclaimed the poor woman in court. However, she seemed to
have trusted rather in her money than in any other providence for her
immunity from an unhappy transformation. But even into this rare depth
of ignorance enough light had penetrated to enable Eliza to cope with
her werewolf in the civilised way of haling her before a magistrate.
When Fenris gets three months with hard labour, he no doubt realises
that he has exceeded his mental habitat, and that the invisible cords
have bound him at last.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After all those brave victories of man over the first
chaos, organic and inorganic, whose effect upon his phantasms has been
indicated; after fire had slain its thousands, and iron its tens of
thousands of his demons, and the rough artisan become a Nemesis with
his rudder and wheel pursuing the hosts of darkness back into Night and
Invisibility; still stood the grim fact of manyformed pain and evil in
the world, still defying the ascending purposes of mankind. Moreover,
confronting these, he is by no means so different mentally from that
man he was before conquering many foes in detail, and laying their
phantoms, as he was morally. More courage man had gained, and more
defiance; and, intellectually, a step had been taken, if only one: he
had learned that his evils are related to each other. Hunger is of many
heads and forms. Its yawning throat may be seen in the brilliant sky
that lasts till it is as brass, in the deluge, the earthquake, in claw
and fang; and then these together do but relate the hunger-brood to
Fire and Ferocity; the summer sunbeam <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb319" href="#v1pb319" name="v1pb319">319</a>]</span>may be venomous
as a serpent, and the end of them all is Death. Some tendency to these
more general conceptions of an opposing principle and power in the
world seems to be represented in that phase of development at which
nondescript forms arise. These were the conquered demons&rsquo;
bequest.</p>
<p>It is, of course, impossible to measure the various forces which
combined to produce the complex symbolical forms of physical evil.
Tradition is not always a good draughtsman, and in portraying for a
distant generation in Germany a big snake killed in India might not be
exact as to the number of its heads or other details. Heroes before
Falstaff were liable to overstate their foes in buckram. The less
measurable a thing by fact, the more immense in fancy: werewolves of
especial magnitude haunted regions where there had not been actual
wolves for centuries; huge serpents play a large part in the annals of
Ireland, where not even the smallest have been found. But after all
natural influences have been considered, one can hardly look upon the
sphynx, the chim&aelig;ra, or on a conventional dragon, without
perceiving that he is in presence of a higher creation than a demonic
bear or a giant ruffian. The fundamental difference between the two
classes is that one is natural, the other pr&aelig;ternatural. Of
course a werewolf is as pr&aelig;ternatural as a gryphon to the eye of
science, but as original expressions of human imagination the former
could hardly have been a more miraculous monster than the Siamese twins
to intelligent people to-day. The demonic forms are generally natural,
albeit caricatured or exaggerated. And this effort at a
pr&aelig;ternatural conception is, in this early form, by no means mere
superstition; rather is it poetic and artistic,&mdash;a kind of crude
effort at <i lang="de">allgemeinheit</i>, at realisation of the types
of evil&mdash;the claw-principle, fang-principle in the universe, the
physiognomies <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb320" href="#v1pb320"
name="v1pb320">320</a>]</span>of venom and pain detached from forms to
which they are accidental.</p>
<p>Some of the particular forms we have been considering are, indeed,
by no means of the prosaic type. Such conceptions as R&aacute;hu,
Cerberus, and several others, are transitional between the natural and
mystical conceptions; while the sphynx, however complete a combination
of ideal forms, is not all demonic. In this Part III. are included
those forms whose combination is not found in objective nature, but
which are yet travesties of nature and genuine fauna of the human
mind.</p>
<p>Perhaps it may be thought somewhat arbitrary that I should describe
all these intermediate forms between demon and devil by the term
<span class="sc">Dragon</span>; but I believe there is no other
fabulous form which includes so many individual types of transition, or
whose evolution may be so satisfactorily traced from the point where it
is linked with the demon to that where it bequeathes its characters to
the devil. While, however, this term is used as the best that suggests
itself, it cannot be accepted as limiting our inquiry or excluding
other abstract forms which ideally correspond to the dragon,&mdash;the
generalised expression for an active, powerful, and intelligent enemy
to mankind, a being who is antagonism organised, and able to command
every weapon in nature for an antihuman purpose.</p>
<p>The opinion has steadily gained that the conventional dragon is the
traditional form of some huge Saurian. It has been suggested that some
of those extinct forms may have been contemporaneous with the earliest
men, and that the traditions of conflicts with them, transmitted orally
and pictorially, have resulted in preserving their forms in fable
(proximately). The restorations of Saurians on their islet at the
Crystal Palace show how much common sense there is in this theory. The
discoveries of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb321" href="#v1pb321"
name="v1pb321">321</a>]</span>Professor Marsh of Yale College have
proved that the general form of the dragon is startlingly prefigured in
nature; and Mr. Alfred Tylor, in an able paper read before the
Anthropological Society, has shown that we are very apt to be on the
safe side in sticking to the theory of an &lsquo;object-origin&rsquo;
for most things.</p>
<p>Concerning this theory, it may be said that the earliest
descriptions, both written and pictorial, which have been discovered of
the reptilian monsters around which grew the germs of our dragon-myths,
are crocodiles or serpents, and not dragons of any conventional
kind,&mdash;with a few doubtful exceptions. In an Egyptian papyrus
there is a hieroglyphic picture of San-nu Hut-ur, &lsquo;plunger of the
sea;&rsquo; it is a marine, dolphin-like monster, with four feet, and a
tail ending in a serpent&rsquo;s head.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e6325src" href="#xd20e6325" name="xd20e6325src">1</a> With wings,
this might approach the dragon-form. Again, Amen-Ra slew <i>Naka</i>,
and this serpent &lsquo;saved his feet.&rsquo; Possibly the phrase is
ironical, and means that the serpent saved nothing; but apart from
that, the poem is too highly metaphorical&mdash;the victorious god
himself being described in it as a &lsquo;beautiful
bull&rsquo;&mdash;for the phrase to be important. On Egyptian monuments
are pictured serpents with human heads and members, and the serpent
Nahab-ka is pictured on amulets with two perfect human legs and
feet.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6331src" href="#xd20e6331" name=
"xd20e6331src">2</a> Winged serpents are found on Egyptian monuments,
but almost as frequently with the incredible number of four as with the
conceivable two wings of the pterodactyl. The forms of the serpents
thus portrayed with anthropomorphic legs and slight wings are, in their
main shapes, of ordinary species. In the Iranian tradition of the
temptation of the first man and woman, Meschia and Meschiane, by the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb322" href="#v1pb322" name=
"v1pb322">322</a>]</span>&rsquo;two-footed serpent of lies.&rsquo; And
it is possible that out of this myth of the &lsquo;two-footed&rsquo;
serpent grew the puzzling legend of Genesis that the serpent of Eden
was sentenced thereafter to crawl on his belly. The snake&rsquo;s lack
of feet, however, might with equal probability have given rise to the
explanation given in mussulman and rabbinical stories of his feet being
cut off by the avenging angel. But the antiquity of the Iranian myth is
doubtful; while the superior antiquity of the Hindu fable of
R&aacute;hu, to which it seems related, suggests that the two legs of
the Ahriman serpent, like the four arms of serpent-tailed R&aacute;hu,
is an anthropomorphic addition. In the ancient planispheres we find the
&lsquo;crooked serpent&rsquo; mentioned in the Book of Job, but no
dragon.</p>
<p>The two great monsters of Vedic mythology, Vritra and Ahi, are not
so distinguishable from each other in the Vedas as in more recent
fables. Vritra is very frequently called Vritra Ahi&mdash;Ahi being
explained in the St. Petersburg Dictionary as &lsquo;the Serpent of the
Heavens, the demon Vritra.&rsquo; Ahi literally means
&lsquo;serpent,&rsquo; answering to the Greek <span class="trans"
title="echi-s, echi-dna"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&#7952;&chi;&iota;-&sigmaf;,
&#7952;&chi;&iota;-&delta;&nu;&alpha;</span></span>; and when anything
is added it appears to be anthropomorphic&mdash;heads, arms,
eyes&mdash;as in the case of the Egyptian serpent-monsters. The Vedic
demon Urana is described as having three heads, six eyes, and
ninety-nine arms.</p>
<p>There would appear to be as little reason for ascribing to the
<i>Tannin</i> of the Old Testament the significance of dragon, though
it is generally so translated. It is used under circumstances which
show it to mean whale, serpent, and various other beasts. Jeremiah
(xiv. 6) compares them to wild asses snuffing the wind, and Micah (i.
8) describes their &lsquo;wailing.&rsquo; The fiery serpents said to
have afflicted Israel in the wilderness are called <i>seraphim</i>, but
neither in their natural or mythological forms do they anticipate our
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb323" href="#v1pb323" name=
"v1pb323">323</a>]</span>conventional dragon beyond the fiery character
that is blended with the serpent character. Nor do the descriptions of
Behemoth and Leviathan comport with the dragon-form.</p>
<p>The serpent as an animal is a consummate development. Its feet, so
far from having been amputated, as the fables say, in punishment of its
sin, have been withdrawn beneath the skin as crutches used in a feebler
period. It is found as a tertiary fossil. Since, therefore, the dragon
form <i lang="la">ex hypothesi</i> is a reminiscence of the huge, now
fossil, Saurians which preceded the serpent in time, the early
mythologies could hardly have so regularly described great serpents
instead of dragons. If the realistic theory we are discussing were
true, the earliest combats&mdash;those of Indra, for
instance&mdash;ought to have been with dragons, and the serpent enemies
would have multiplied as time went on; but the reverse is the
case&mdash;the (alleged) extinct forms being comparatively modern in
heroic legend.</p>

<p>Mr. John Ruskin once remarked upon Turner&rsquo;s picture of the
Dragon guarding the Hesperides, that this conception so early as 1806,
when no Saurian skeleton was within the artist&rsquo;s reach, presented
a singular instance of the scientific imagination. As a coincidence
with such extinct forms Turner&rsquo;s dragon is surpassed by the
monster on which a witch rides in one of the engravings of Della Bella,
published in 1637. In that year, on the occasion of the marriage of the
grand duke Ferdinand II. in Florence, there was a masque <i lang=
"it">d&rsquo;Inferno</i>, whose representations were engraved by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb324" href="#v1pb324" name=
"v1pb324">324</a>]</span>Della Bella, of which this is one, so that it
may be rather to some scenic artist than to the distinguished imitator
of Callot that we owe this grotesque form, which the late Mr. Wright
said &lsquo;might have been borrowed from some distant geological
period.&rsquo; If so, the fact would present a curious coincidence with
the true history of Turner&rsquo;s Dragon; for after Mr. Ruskin had
published his remark about the scientific imagination represented in
it, an old friend of the artist declared that Turner himself had told
him that he copied that dragon from a Christmas spectacle in Drury Lane
theatre. But Turner had shown the truest scientific instinct in
repairing to the fossil-beds of human imagination, and drawing thence
the conventional form which never had existence save as the structure
of cumulative tradition. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb325" href=

<p class="first">In the accompanying picture, a medal of the ancient
city of Tyre, two of the most beautiful forms of nature are brought
together,&mdash;the Serpent and the Egg. Mr. D. R. Hay has shown the
endless extent to which the oval arches have been reproduced in the
ceramic arts of antiquity; and the same sense of symmetry which made
the Greek vase a combination of Eggs prevails in the charm which the
same graceful outline possesses wherever suggested,&mdash;as in curves
of the swan, crescent of the moon, the elongated shell,&mdash;on which
Aphrodite may well be poised, since the same contours find their
consummate expression in the flowing lines attaining their repose in
the perfect form of woman. The Serpent&mdash;<span class=

"v1pb326">326</a>]</span>model of the &lsquo;line of grace and
beauty&rsquo;&mdash;has had an even larger fascination for the eye of
the artist and the poet. It is the one active form in nature which
cannot be ungraceful, and to estimate the extent of its use in
decoration is impossible, because all undulating and coiling lines are
necessarily serpent forms. But in addition to the perfections of this
form&mdash;which fulfil all the ascent of forms in Swedenborg&rsquo;s
mystical morphology, circular, spiral, perpetual-circular, vortical,
celestial&mdash;the Serpent bears on it, as it were, gems of the
underworld that seem to find their counterpart in galaxies.</p>

<p>One must conclude that Serpent-worship is mainly founded in fear.
The sacrifices offered to that animal are alone sufficient to prove
this. But as it is certain that the Serpent appears in symbolism and
poetry in many ways which have little or no relation to its terrors, we
may well doubt whether it may not have had a career in the human
imagination previous to either of the results of its reign of
terror,&mdash;worship and execration. It is the theory of Pestalozzi
that every child is born an artist, and through its pictorial sense
must be led on its first steps of education. The infant world displayed
also in its selection of sacred trees and animals a profound
appreciation of beauty. The myths in which the Serpent is represented
as kakodemon refer rather to its natural history than to its
appearance; and even when its natural history came to be observed,
there was&mdash;there now is&mdash;such a wide discrepancy between its
physiology and its functions, also between its intrinsic characters and
their relation to man, that we can only accept its various aspects in
mythology without attempting to trace their relative precedence in
time.</p>
<p>The past may in this case be best interpreted by the present. How
different now to wise and observant men are the suggestions of this
exceptional form in nature! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb327"
href="#v1pb327" name="v1pb327">327</a>]</span></p>
<p>Let us read a passage concerning it from Ralph Waldo
Emerson:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the old aphorism, <i>nature is always self-similar</i>. In
the plant, the eye or germinative point opens to a leaf, then to
another leaf, with a power of transforming the leaf into radicle,
stamen, pistil, petal, bract, sepal, or seed. The whole art of the
plant is still to repeat leaf on leaf without end, the more or less of
heat, light, moisture, and food, determining the form it shall assume.
In the animal, nature makes a vertebra, or a spine of vertebr&aelig;,
and helps herself still by a new spine, with a limited power of
modifying its form,&mdash;spine on spine, to the end of the world. A
poetic anatomist, in our own day, teaches that a snake being a
horizontal line, and man being an erect line, constitute a right angle;
and between the lines of this mystical quadrant, all animated beings
find their place: and he assumes the hair-worm, the span-worm, or the
snake, as the type or prediction of the spine. Manifestly, at the end
of the spine, nature puts out smaller spines, as arms; at the end of
the arms, new spines, as hands; at the other end she repeats the
process, as legs and feet. At the top of the column she puts out
another spine, which doubles or loops itself over, as a span-worm, into
a ball, and forms the skull, with extremities again: the hands being
now the upper jaw, the feet the lower jaw, the fingers and toes being
represented this time by upper and lower teeth. This new spine is
destined to high uses. It is a new man on the shoulders of the
last.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6417src" href="#xd20e6417"
name="xd20e6417src">1</a></p>
<p>As one reads this it might be asked, How could its idealism be more
profoundly pictured for the eye than in the Serpent coiled round the
egg,&mdash;the seed out of which all these spines must branch out for
their protean variations? What refrains of ancient themes subtly sound
between the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb328" href="#v1pb328"
name="v1pb328">328</a>]</span>lines,&mdash;from the Serpent doomed to
crawl on its belly in the dust, to the Serpent that is lifted up!</p>
<p>Now let us turn to the page of Jules Michelet, and read what the
Serpent signified to one mood of his sympathetic nature.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was one of my saddest hours when, seeking in nature a
refuge from thoughts of the age, I for the first time encountered the
head of the viper. This occurred in a valuable museum of anatomical
imitations.</p>
<p>The head marvellously imitated and enormously enlarged, so as to
remind one of the tiger&rsquo;s and the jaguar&rsquo;s, exposed in its
horrible form a something still more horrible. You seized at once the
delicate, infinite, fearfully prescient precautions by which the deadly
machine is so potently armed. Not only is it provided with numerous
keen-edged teeth, not only are these teeth supplied with an ingenious
reservoir of poison which slays immediately, but their extreme fineness
which renders them liable to fracture is compensated by an advantage
that perhaps no other animal possesses, namely, a magazine of
supernumerary teeth, to supply at need the place of any accidentally
broken. Oh, what provisions for killing! What precautions that the
victim shall not escape! What love for this horrible creature! I stood
by it <i>scandalised</i>, if I may so speak, and with a sick soul.
Nature, the great mother, by whose side I had taken refuge, shocked me
with a maternity so cruelly impartial. Gloomily I walked away, bearing
on my heart a darker shadow than rested on the day itself, one of the
sternest in winter. I had come forth like a child; I returned home like
an orphan, feeling the notion of a Providence dying away within
me.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6434src" href="#xd20e6434" name=
"xd20e6434src">2</a></p>
<p>Many have so gone forth and so returned; some to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb329" href="#v1pb329" name=
"v1pb329">329</a>]</span>say, &lsquo;There is no God;&rsquo; a few to
say (as is reported of a living poet), &lsquo;I believe in God, but am
against him;&rsquo; but some also to discern in the viper&rsquo;s head
Nature&rsquo;s ironclad, armed with her best science to defend the
advance of form to humanity along narrow passes.</p>
<p>The primitive man was the child that went forth when his world was
also a child, and when the Serpent was still doing its part towards
making him and it a man. It was a long way from him to the
dragon-slayer; but it is much that he did not merely cower; he watched
and observed, and there is not one trait belonging to his deadly
crawling contemporaries that he did not note and spiritualise in such
science as was possible to him.</p>
<p>The last-discovered of the topes in India represents
Serpent-worshippers gathered around their deity, holding their tongues
with finger and thumb. No living form in nature could be so fitly
regarded in that attitude. Not only is the Serpent normally silent, but
in its action it has &lsquo;the quiet of perfect motion.&rsquo; The
maximum of force is shown in it, relatively to its size, along with the
minimum of friction and visible effort. Footless, wingless, as a star,
its swift gliding and darting is sometimes like the lightning whose
forked tongue it seemed to incarnate. The least touch of its ingenious
tooth is more destructive than the lion&rsquo;s jaw. What mystery in
its longevity, in its self-subsistence, in its self-renovation! Out of
the dark it comes arrayed in jewels, a crawling magazine of death in
its ire, in its unknown purposes able to renew its youth, and fable for
man imperishable life! Wonderful also are its mimicries. It sometimes
borrows colours of the earth on which it reposes, the trees on which it
hangs, now seems covered with eyes, and the &lsquo;spectacled
snake&rsquo; appeared to have artificially added to its vision.
Altogether it is unique among natural forms, and its vast <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb330" href="#v1pb330" name=
"v1pb330">330</a>]</span>history in religious speculation and mythology
does credit to the observation of primitive man.</p>
<p>Recent experiments have shown the monkeys stand in the greatest
terror of snakes. Such terror is more and more recognised as a survival
in the European man. The Serpent is almost the only animal which can
follow a monkey up a tree and there attack its young. Our arboreal
anthropoid progenitors could best have been developed in some place
naturally enclosed and fortified, as by precipices which quadrupeds
could not scale, but which apes might reach by swinging and leaping
from trees. But there could be no seclusion where the Serpent could not
follow. I am informed by the King of Bonny that in his region of Africa
the only serpent whose worship is fully maintained is the <i>Nomboh</i>
(Leaper), a small snake, white and glistening, whose bite is fatal, and
which, climbing into trees, springs thence upon its prey beneath, and
can travel far by leaping from branch to branch. The first arboreal man
who added a little to the natural defences of any situation might stand
in tradition as a god planting a garden; but even he would not be
supposed able to devise any absolute means of defence against the
subtlest of all the beasts. Among the three things Solomon found too
wonderful for him was &lsquo;the way of a serpent upon a rock&rsquo;
(Prov. xxx. 19). This comparative superiority of the Serpent to any and
all devices and contrivances known to primitive men&mdash;whose
proverbs must have made most of Solomon&rsquo;s wisdom&mdash;would
necessarily have its effect upon the animal and mental nerves of our
race in early times, and the Serpent would find in his sanctity a
condition favourable to survival and multiplication. It is this fatal
power of superstition to change fancies into realities which we find
still protecting the Serpent in various countries. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb331" href="#v1pb331" name=
"v1pb331">331</a>]</span>From being venerated as the arbiter of life
and death, it might thus actually become such in large districts of
country. In Dubufe&rsquo;s picture of the Fall of Man, the wrath of
Jehovah is represented by the lightning, which has shattered the tree
beneath which the offending pair are now crouching; beyond it Satan is
seen in human shape raising his arm in proud defiance against the
blackened sky. So would the Serpent appear. His victims were counted by
many thousands where the lightning laid low one. Transmitted along the
shuddering nerves of many generations came the confession of the Son of
Sirach, &lsquo;There is no head above the head of a serpent.&rsquo;

<p class="first">On the eve of January 1, 1863,&mdash;that historic New
Year&rsquo;s Day on which President Lincoln proclaimed freedom to
American slaves,&mdash;I was present at a Watchnight held by negroes in
a city of that country. In opening the meeting the preacher
said,&mdash;though in words whose eloquent shortcomings I cannot
reproduce:&mdash;&lsquo;Brethren and sisters, the President of the
United States has promised that, if the Confederates do not lay down
their arms, he will free all their slaves to-morrow. They have not laid
down their arms. To-morrow will be the day of liberty to the oppressed.
But we all know that evil powers are around the President. While we sit
here they are trying to make him break his word. But we have come
together to watch, and see that he does not break his word. Brethren,
the bad influences around the President to-night are stronger than any
Copperheads.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6472src" href="#xd20e6472"
name="xd20e6472src">1</a> The Old Serpent is abroad to-night, with all
his emissaries, in great power. His wrath is great, because he knows
his hour is near. He will be in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb333"
href="#v1pb333" name="v1pb333">333</a>]</span>this church this evening.
As midnight comes on we shall hear his rage. But, brethren and sisters,
don&rsquo;t be alarmed. Our prayers will prevail. His head will be
bruised. His back will be broken. He will go raging to hell, and God
Almighty&rsquo;s New Year will make the United States a true land of
freedom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sensation caused among the hundreds of negroes present by these
words was profound; they were frequently interrupted by cries of
&lsquo;Glory!&rsquo; and there were tears of joy. But the scene and
excitement which followed were indescribable. A few moments before
midnight the congregation were requested to kneel, which they did, and
prayer succeeded prayer with increasing fervour. Presently a loud,
prolonged hiss was heard. There were cries&mdash;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s
here! he&rsquo;s here!&rsquo; Then came a volley of hisses; they seemed
to proceed from every part of the room, hisses so entirely like those
of huge serpents that the strongest nerves were shaken; above them rose
the preacher&rsquo;s prayer that had become a wild incantation, and
ecstatic ejaculations became so universal that it was a marvel what
voices were left to make the hisses. Finally, from a neighbouring
steeple the twelve strokes of midnight sounded on the frosty air, and
immediately the hisses diminished, and presently died away altogether,
and the New Year that brought freedom to four millions of slaves was
ushered in by the jubilant chorus of all present singing a hymn of
victory.</p>
<p>Far had come those hisses and that song of victory, terminating the
dragon-drama of America. In them was the burden of Ezekiel: &lsquo;Son
of man, set thy face against Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and prophesy
against him and against all Egypt, saying, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah:
Behold I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that
lieth in the midst of the rivers ... I will put a hook in thy
jaws.&rsquo; In them was the burden of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb334" href="#v1pb334" name="v1pb334">334</a>]</span>Isaiah:
&lsquo;In that day Jehovah with his sore and great and strong sword
shall punish Leviathan the piercing serpent, even Leviathan that
crooked serpent: he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.&rsquo; In
it was the cry of Zophar: &lsquo;His meat in his bowels is turned, it
is the gall of asps within him. He hath swallowed down riches, and he
shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.&rsquo;
And these Hebrew utterances, again, were but the distant echoes of far
earlier voices of those African slaves still seen pictured with their
chains on the ruined walls of Egypt,&mdash;voices that gathered courage
at last to announce the never-ending struggle of man with Oppression,
as that combat between god and serpent which never had a nobler event
than when the dying hiss of Slavery was heard in America, and the
victorious Sun rose upon a New World of free and equal men.</p>
<p>The Serpent thus exalted in America to a type of oppression is very
different from any snake that may this day be found worshipped as a
deity by the African in his native land. The swarthy snake-worshipper
in his migration took his god along with him in his chest or
basket&mdash;at once ark and altar&mdash;and in that hiding-place it
underwent transformations. He emerged as the protean emblem of both
good and evil. In a mythologic sense the serpent certainly held its
tail in its mouth. No civilisation has reached the end of its typical
supremacy.</p>

</div>
<p>Concerning the accompanying Eleusinian form (<a href="#v1fig24">Fig.
24</a>), Calmet says:&mdash;&lsquo;The mysterious trunk, coffer, or
basket, may be justly reckoned among the most remarkable and sacred
instruments of worship, which formed part of the processional
ceremonies in the heathen world. This was held so sacred that it was
not publicly exposed to view, or publicly opened, but was reserved for
the inspection <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb335" href="#v1pb335"
name="v1pb335">335</a>]</span>of the initiated, the fully initiated
only. Completely to explain this symbol would require a dissertation;
and, indeed, it has been considered, more or less, by those who have
written on the nature of the Ark of the testimony among the Hebrews.
Declining the inquiry at present, we merely call the attention of the
reader to what this mystical coffer was supposed to contain&mdash;a
serpent!&rsquo; The French Benedictine who wrote this passage, though
his usual candour shames the casuistry of our own time, found it
necessary to conceal the Hebrew Ark: it was precisely so that the
occupant of the Ark was originally concealed; and though St. John
exorcised it from the Chalice its genius lingers in the Pyx, before
whose Host &lsquo;lifted up&rsquo; the eyes of worshippers are
lowered.</p>
<p>The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews (chap. ix.), describing the
Tabernacle, says: &lsquo;After the second veil, the tabernacle which is
called the Holiest of all; which had the golden censer, and the ark of
the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot
that had manna, and Aaron&rsquo;s rod that budded, and the tables of
the covenant.&rsquo; But this rod of Aaron, which, by budding, had
swallowed up all rival pretensions to the tribal priesthood, was the
same rod which had been changed to a serpent, and swallowed up the
rod-serpents of the sorcerers in Pharaoh&rsquo;s presence. So soft and
subtle is &lsquo;the way of a serpent upon a rock!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This veiling of the Serpent, significant of a great deal, is
characteristic even of the words used to name it. Of these I have
selected one to head this chapter, because it is one of the innumerable
veils which shielded this reptile&rsquo;s transformation from a
particular external danger to a demonic type. This general description
of things that wind about or turn (<i>vermes</i>, traced by some to the
Sanskrit root <i>hvar</i>, &lsquo;curved&rsquo;), gradually came into
use to express the demon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb336" href=
"#v1pb336" name="v1pb336">336</a>]</span>serpents. Dante and Milton
call Satan a worm. No doubt among the two hundred names for the
Serpent, said to be mentioned in an Arabic work, we should find
parallels to this old adaptation of the word &lsquo;worm.&rsquo; In
countries&mdash;as Germany and England&mdash;where no large serpents
are found, the popular imagination could not be impressed by merely
saying that Siegfried or Lambton had slain a snake. The tortuous
character of the snake was preserved, but, by that unconscious
dexterity which so often appears in the making of myths, it was
expanded so as to include a power of supernatural transformation. The
Lambton worm comes out of the well very small, but it afterwards coils
in nine huge folds around its hill. The hag-ridden daughter of the King
of Northumberland, who</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd20e4683">crept into a hole a worm</p>
<p class="line">And out stept a fair ladye,</p>
</div>
<p class="first">did but follow the legendary rule of the demonic
serpent tribe.</p>
<p>Why was the Serpent slipped into the Ark or coffer and hid behind
veils? To answer this will require here an episode.</p>
<p>In the Etruscan theology and ceremonial the supreme power was lodged
with certain deities that were never seen. They were called the
<i lang="la">Dii Involuti</i>, the veiled gods. Not even the priests
ever looked upon them. When any dire calamity occurred, it was said
these mysterious deities had spoken their word in the council of the
gods,&mdash;a word always final and fatal.</p>
<p>There have been fine theories on the subject, and the Etruscans have
been complimented for having high transcendental views of the invisible
nature of the Divine Being. But a more prosaic theory is probably true.
These gods were wrapped up because they were not fit to be seen. The
rude carvings of some savage tribe, they had been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb337" href="#v1pb337" name=
"v1pb337">337</a>]</span>seen and adored at first: temples had been
built for them, and their priesthood had grown powerful; but as art
advanced and beautiful statues arose, these rude designs could not bear
the contrast, and the only way of preserving reverence for them, and
the institutions grown up around them, was to hide them out of sight
altogether. Then it could be said they were so divinely beautiful that
the senses would be overpowered by them.</p>
<p>There have been many veiled deities, and though their veils have
been rationalised, they are easily pierced. The inscription on the
temple of Isis at Sais was: &lsquo;I am that which has been, which is,
and which shall be, and no one has yet lifted the veil that hides
me.&rsquo; Isis at this time had probably become a negro Madonna, like
that still worshipped in Spain as holiest of images, and called by the
same title, &lsquo;Our Immaculate Lady.&rsquo; As the fair race and the
dark mingled in Egypt, the primitive Nubian complexion and features of
Isis could not inspire such reverence as more anciently, and before her
also a curtain was hung. The Ark of Moses carried this veil into the
wilderness, and concealed objects not attractive to look
at&mdash;probably two scrawled stones, some bones said to be those of
Joseph, a pot of so-called manna, and the staff said to have once been
a serpent and afterwards blossomed. Fashioned by a rude tribe, the Ark
was a fit thing to hide, and hidden it has been to this day. When the
veil of the Temple was rent,&mdash;allegorically at the death of
Christ, actually by Titus,&mdash;nothing of the kind was found; and it
would seem that the Jews must long have been worshipping before a veil
with emptiness behind it. Paul discovered that the veil said to have
covered the face of Moses when he descended from Sinai was a myth; it
meant that the people should not see to the end of what was
nevertheless transient. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb338" href=
"#v1pb338" name="v1pb338">338</a>]</span>&lsquo;Their minds were
blinded; for unto this day, when Moses is read, that veil is on their
heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Kircher says the Seraphs of Egypt were images without any eminency
of limbs, rolled as it were in swaddling clothes, partly made of stone,
partly of metal, wood, or shell. Similar images, he says, were called
by the Romans &lsquo;secret gods.&rsquo; As an age of scepticism
advanced, it was sometimes necessary that these &lsquo;<span lang=
"la">involuti</span>&rsquo; should be slightly revealed, lest it should
be said there was no god there at all. Such is the case with the famous
<i lang="it">bambino</i> of Arac&oelig;li Church in Rome. This effigy,
said to have been carved by a pilgrim out of a tree on the Mount of
Olives, and painted by St. Luke while the pilgrim was sleeping, is now
kept in its ark, and visitors are allowed to see part of its painted
face. When the writer of this requested a sight of the whole form, or
of the head at any rate, the exhibiting priest was astounded at the
suggestion. No doubt he was right: the only wonder is that the face is
not hid also, for a more ingeniously ugly thing than the flat,
blackened, and rouged visage of the bambino it were difficult to
conceive. But it wears a very cunning veil nevertheless. The face is
set in marvellous brilliants, but these are of less effect in hiding
its ugliness than the vesture of mythology around it. The adjacent
walls are covered with pictures of the miracles it has performed, and
which have attracted to it such faith that it is said at one time to
have received more medical fees than all the physicians in Rome
together. Priests have discovered that a veil over the mind is thicker
than a veil on the god. Such is the popular veneration for the bambino,
that, in 1849, the Republicans thought it politic to present the monks
with the Pope&rsquo;s state coach to carry the idol about. In the end
it was proved that the Pope was securely seated beside <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb339" href="#v1pb339" name=
"v1pb339">339</a>]</span>the bambino, and he presently emerged from
behind his veil also.</p>
<p>There came, then, a period when the Serpent crept behind the veil,
or lid of the ark, or into a chalice,&mdash;a very small worm, but yet
able to gnaw the staff of Solomon. No wisdom could be permitted to rise
above fear itself, though its special sources might be here and there
reduced or vanquished. The snake had taught man at last its arts of
war. Man had summoned to his aid the pig, and the ibis made havoc among
the reptiles; and some of that terror which is the parent of that kind
of devotion passed away. When it next emerged, it was in twofold
guise,&mdash;as Agathodemon and Kakodemon,&mdash;but in both forms as
the familiar of some higher being. It was as the genius of Minerva, of
Esculapius, of St. Euphemia. We have already seen him (<a href=
"#v1fig13">Fig. 13</a>) as the genius of the Eleans, the Sosopolis,
where also we see the Serpent hurrying into his cavern, leaving the
mother and child to be worshipped in the temple of Lucina. In Christian
symbolism the Seraphim&mdash;&lsquo;burning (<i>s&aacute;raf</i>)
serpents&rsquo;&mdash;veiled their faces and forms beneath their huge
wings, crossed in front, and so have been able to become &lsquo;the
eminent,&rsquo; and to join in the praises of modern communities at
being delivered from just such imaginary fiery worms as themselves!

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The considerations advanced in the previous chapter
enable us to dismiss with facility many of the rationalistic
interpretations which have been advanced to explain the monstrous
serpents of sacred books by reference to imaginary species supposed to
be now extinct. Flying serpents, snakes many-headed, rain-bringing,
woman-hating, &amp;c., may be suffered to survive as the fauna of
bibliolatrous imaginations. Such forms, however, are of such mythologic
importance that it is necessary to watch carefully against this method
of realistic interpretation, especially as there are many actual
characteristics of serpents sufficiently mysterious to conspire with
it. A recent instance of this literalism may here be noticed.</p>
<p>Mr. W. R. Cooper<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6567src" href=
"#xd20e6567" name="xd20e6567src">1</a> supposes the evil serpent of
Egyptian Mythology to have a real basis in &lsquo;a large and
unidentified species of coluber, of great strength and hideous
longitude,&rsquo; which &lsquo;was, even from the earliest ages,
associated as the representative of spiritual, and occasionally
physical evil, and was named Hof, Rehof, or Apophis,<span class="corr"
id="xd20e6570" title="Not in source">&rsquo;</span> the
&lsquo;<i>destroyer</i>, the <i>enemy of the gods</i>, and the
<i>devourer</i> of the souls of men.&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb341" href="#v1pb341" name=
"v1pb341">341</a>]</span>That such a creature, he adds, &lsquo;once
inhabited the Libyan desert, we have the testimony of both Hanno the
Carthaginian and Lucan the Roman, and if it is now no longer an
inhabitant of that region, it is probably owing to the advance of
civilisation having driven it farther south.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Apart from the extreme improbability that African exploration should
have brought no rumours of such a monster if it existed, it may be said
concerning Mr. Cooper&rsquo;s theory: (1.) If, indeed, the references
cited were to a reptile now unknown, we might be led by mythologic
analogy to expect that it would have been revered beyond either the Asp
or the Cobra. In proportion to the fear has generally been the
exaltation of its objects. Primitive peoples have generally gathered
courage to pour invective upon evil monsters when&mdash;either from
their non-existence or rarity&mdash;there was least danger of its being
practically resented as a personal affront. (2.) The regular folds of
Apophis on the sarcophagus of Seti I. and elsewhere are so evidently
mystical and conventional that, apparently, they refer to a
serpent-form only as the guilloche on a wall may refer to sea-waves.
Apophis (or Apap) would have been a decorative artist to fold himself
in such order.</p>
<p>These impossible labyrinthine coils suggest Time, as the serpent
with its tail in its mouth signifies Eternity,&mdash;an evolution of
the same idea. This was the interpretation given by a careful scholar,
the late William Hickson,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6589src" href=
"#xd20e6589" name="xd20e6589src">2</a> to the procession of nine
persons depicted on the sarcophagus mentioned as bearing a serpent,
each holding a fold, all being regular enough for a frieze. &lsquo;The
scene,&rsquo; says this author, &lsquo;appears to relate to the Last
Judgment, for Osiris is seen on his throne, passing sentence on a crowd
before him; and in the same tableaux are depicted the river that
divides the living from the dead, and the bridge <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb342" href="#v1pb342" name=
"v1pb342">342</a>]</span>of life. The death of the serpent may possibly
be intended to symbolise the end of time.&rsquo; This idea of long
duration might be a general one relating to all time, or it might refer
to the duration of individual life; it involved naturally the evils and
agonies of life; but the fundamental conception is more simple, and
also more poetic, than even these implications, and it means eternal
waste and decay. One has need only to sit before a clock to see
Apophis: there coil upon coil winds the ever-moving monster, whose
tooth is remorseless, devouring little by little the strength and
majesty of man, and reducing his grandest achievements&mdash;even his
universe&mdash;to dust. Time is the undying Worm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb343" href="#v1pb343" name=

<p>The natural history of Apophis, so far as he has any, is probably
suggested in the following passage cited by Mr. Cooper from
Wilkinson:&mdash;&lsquo;&AElig;lian relates many strange stories of the
asp, and the respect paid to it by the Egyptians; but we may suppose
that in his sixteen species of asps other snakes were included. He also
speaks of a dragon which was sacred in the Egyptian Melite, and another
kind of snake called Paries or Paruas, dedicated to &AElig;sculapius.
The serpent of Melite had priests and ministers, a table and bowl. It
was kept in a tower, and fed by the priests with cakes made of flour
and honey, which they placed there in a bowl. Having done this they
retired. The next day, on returning to the apartment, the food was
found to be eaten, and the same quantity was again put into the bowl,
for it was not lawful for any one to see the sacred
reptile.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6659src" href="#xd20e6659"
name="xd20e6659src">4</a></p>
<p>It was in this concealment from the outward eye that the Serpent was
able to assume such monstrous proportions to the eye of imagination;
and, indeed, it is not beyond conjecture that this serpent of Melite,
coming in conflict with Osirian worship, was degraded and demonised
into that evil monster (Apophis) whom Horus slew to avenge his
destruction of Osiris (for he was often identified with Typhon).</p>
<p>Though Horus cursed and slew this terrible demon-serpent, he
reappears in all Egyptian Mythology with undiminished strength, and all
evil powers were the brood <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb344" href=
"#v1pb344" name="v1pb344">344</a>]</span>of himself or Typhon, who were
sometimes described as brothers and sometimes as the same beings. From
the &lsquo;Ritual of the Dead&rsquo; we learn that it was the high
privilege and task of the heroic dead to be reconstructed and go forth
to encounter and subdue the agents of Apophis, who sent out to engage
them the crocodiles Seb, Hem, and Shui, and other crocodiles from
north, south, east, and west; the hero having conquered these, acquires
their might, and next prevails over the walking viper Ru; and so on
with other demons called &lsquo;precursors of Apophis,&rsquo; until
their prince himself is encountered and slain, all the hero&rsquo;s
guardian deities attending to fix a knife in each of the
monster&rsquo;s folds. These are the Vanquishers of Time,&mdash;the
immortal.</p>
<p>In Apophis we find the Serpent fairly developed to a principle of
evil. He is an &lsquo;accuser of the sun;&rsquo; the twelve gateways
into Hades are surmounted by his representatives, which the Sun must
pass&mdash;twelve hours of night. He is at once the &lsquo;Nachash
beriach&rsquo; and &lsquo;Nachash aktalon&rsquo;&mdash;the
&lsquo;Cross-bar serpent&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Tortuous
serpent&rsquo;&mdash;which we meet with in Isa. xxvii. 1: &lsquo;In
that day the Lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish
leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked
serpent.&rsquo; The marginal translation in the English version is
&lsquo;crossing like a bar,&rsquo; instead of piercing, and the Vulgate
has <i lang="la">serpens vectis</i>. This refers to the moral function
of the serpent, as barring the way, or guarding the door. No doubt this
is the &lsquo;crooked serpent&rsquo; of Job xxvi. 13, for the
astrological sense of it does not invalidate the terrestrial
significance. Imagination could only project into the heavens what it
had learned on earth. Bochart in identifying
&lsquo;Nachash-beriach&rsquo; as &lsquo;the flying Serpent,&rsquo; is
quite right: the Seraph, or winged Serpent, which barred the way to the
tree of life in Eden, and in some <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb345" href="#v1pb345" name="v1pb345">345</a>]</span>traditions was
the treacherous guard at the gate of the garden, and which bit Israel
in the wilderness, was this same protean Apophis. For such tasks, and
to soar into the celestial planisphere, the Serpent must needs have
wings; and thus it is already far on its way to become the flying
Dragon. But in one form, as the betrayer of man, it must lose its wings
and crawl upon the ground for ever. The Serpent is thus not so much
agathodemon and kakodemon in one form, as a principle of
destructiveness which is sometimes employed by the deity to punish his
enemies, as Horus employs fiery Kheti, but sometimes requires to be
himself punished.</p>
<p>There have been doubts whether the familiar derivation of
<span class="trans" title="ophis"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&#8004;&phi;&iota;&sigmaf;</span></span>, serpent, from
<span class="trans" title="ops"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&#8004;&psi;</span></span>, the eye, shall continue. Some connect
the Greek word with <span class="trans" title="echis"><span class=
"Greek" lang="el">&#7956;&chi;&iota;&sigmaf;</span></span>, but Curtius
maintains that the old derivation from <span class="trans" title=
"ops"><span class="Greek" lang="el">&#8004;&psi;</span></span> is
correct.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6725src" href="#xd20e6725" name=
"xd20e6725src">5</a> Even were this not the etymology, the popularity
of it would equally suggest the fact that this reptile was of old
supposed to kill with its glance; and it was also generally regarded as
gifted with pr&aelig;ternatural vision. By a similar process to that
which developed avenging Furies out of the detective
dawn&mdash;<span class="corr" id="xd20e6729" title=
"Source: Erinys">Erinyes</span> from Saranyu, Satan from
Lucifer<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6732src" href="#xd20e6732" name=
"xd20e6732src">6</a>&mdash;this subtle Spy might have become also a
retributive and finally a malignant power. The Furies were portrayed
bearing serpents in their hands, and each of these might carry ideally
the terrors of Apophis: Time also is a detective, and the guilty heard
it saying, &lsquo;Your sin will find you out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Through many associations of this kind the Serpent became at an
early period an agent of ordeal. Any one handling it with impunity was
regarded as in league with it, or specially hedged about by the deity
whose <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb346" href="#v1pb346" name=
"v1pb346">346</a>]</span>&rsquo;hands formed the crooked
serpent.&rsquo; It may have been as snake-charmers that Moses and Aaron
appeared before Pharaoh and influenced his imagination; or, if the
story be a myth, its existence still shows that serpent performances
would then have been regarded as credentials of divine authentication.
So when Paul was shipwrecked on Malta, where a viper is said to have
fastened on his hand, the barbarians, having at first inferred that he
was a murderer, &lsquo;whom though he hath escaped the sea, yet
Vengeance suffereth not to live,&rsquo; concluded he was a god when
they found him unharmed. Innumerable traditions preceded the words
ascribed to Christ (Luke x. 19), &lsquo;Behold, I give unto you power
to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the
enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.&rsquo; It is
instructive to compare this sentence attributed to Christ with the
notion of the barbarians concerning Paul&rsquo;s adventure, whatever it
may have been. Paul&rsquo;s familiarity with the Serpent seems to them
proof that he is a god. Such also is the idea represented in Isa. xi.
8, &lsquo;The sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp.&rsquo;
But the idea of treading on serpents marks a period more nearly
corresponding to that of the infant Hercules strangling the serpents.
Yet though these two conceptions&mdash;serpent-treading, and
serpent-slaying&mdash;approach each other, they are very different in
source and significance, both morally and historically. The word used
in Luke, <span class="trans" title="pateiin"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&pi;&alpha;&tau;&epsilon;&iota;&#8150;&nu;</span></span>, conveys
the idea of walking over something in majesty, not in hostility; it
must be interpreted by the next sentence (x. 20),
&lsquo;Notwithstanding, in this rejoice not, that the spirits are
subject unto you (<span class="trans" title=
"ta pneumata hypotassetai"><span class="Greek" lang="el">&tau;&alpha;
&pi;&nu;&epsilon;&#8059;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;
&#8017;&pi;&omicron;&tau;&#8049;&sigma;&sigma;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota;</span></span>).&rsquo;
The serpent-slayer or dragon-slayer is not of Semitic origin. The awful
supremacy of Jehovah held all the powers of destruction chained to his
hand; and to ask man if he could draw out <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb347" href="#v1pb347" name="v1pb347">347</a>]</span>Leviathan with
a hook was only another form of reminding him of his own inferiority to
the creator and lord of Leviathan. How true the Semitic ideas running
<span class="corr" id="xd20e6767" title="Source: though">through</span>
the Bible, and especially represented in the legend of Paul in Malta,
are to the barbarian nature is illustrated by an incident related in
Mr. Brinton&rsquo;s &lsquo;Myths of the New World.&rsquo; The pious
founder of the Moravian Brotherhood, Count Zinzendorf, was visiting a
missionary station among the Shawnees in the Wyoming Valley, America.
Recent quarrels with the white people had so irritated the red men that
they resolved to make him their victim. After he had retired to his hut
several of the braves softly peered in. Count Zinzendorf was seated
before a fire, lost in perusal of the Scriptures; and while the red men
gazed they saw what he did not&mdash;a huge rattlesnake trailing across
his feet to gather itself in a coil before the comfortable warmth of
the fire. Immediately they forsook their murderous purpose, and retired
noiselessly, convinced that this was indeed a divine man. <span class=

<p class="first">That Serpent-worship in India was developed by
euphemism seems sufficiently shown in the famous Vedic hymn called
<i>Kankato na</i>, recited as an antidote against all venom, of which
the following is a translation:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;1. Some creature of little venom; some creature of great
venom; or some venomous aquatic reptile; creatures of two kinds, both
destructive of life, or poisonous, unseen creatures, have anointed me
with their poison.</p>
<p>&lsquo;2. The antidote coming to the bitten person destroys the
unseen venomous creatures; departing it destroys them; deprived of
substance it destroys them by its odour; being ground it pulverises
them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;3. Blades of <i>sara</i> grass, of <i>kusara</i>, of
<i>darhba</i>, of <i>sairya</i>, of <i>munja</i>, of <i>virana</i>, all
the haunt of unseen venomous creatures, have together anointed me with
their venom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;4. The cows had lain down in their stalls; the wild beasts
had retreated to their lairs; the senses of men were at rest; when the
unseen venomous creatures anointed me with their venom. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb349" href="#v1pb349" name=
"v1pb349">349</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;5. Or they may be discovered in the dark, as thieves in the
dusk of evening; for although they be unseen yet all are seen by them;
therefore, men be vigilant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;6. Heaven, serpents, is your father; Earth, your mother;
Soma, your brother; Aditi, your sister; unseen, all-seeing, abide in
your holes; enjoy your own good pleasure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;7. Those who move with their shoulders, those who move with
their bodies, those who sting with sharp fangs, those who are
virulently venomous; what do ye here, ye unseen, depart together far
from us.</p>
<p>&lsquo;8. The all-seeing Sun rises in the East, the destroyer of the
unseen, driving away all the unseen venomous creatures, and all evil
spirits.</p>
<p>&lsquo;9. The Sun has risen on high, destroying all the many
poisons; Aditya, the all-seeing, the destroyer of the unseen, rises for
the good of living beings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;10. I deposit the poison in the solar orb, like a leathern
bottle in the house of a vendor of spirits; verily that adorable Sun
never dies; nor through his favour shall we die of the venom; for,
though afar off, yet drawn by his coursers he will overtake the poison:
the science of antidotes converted thee, Poison, to ambrosia.</p>
<p>&lsquo;11. That insignificant little bird has swallowed thy venom;
she does not die; nor shall we die; for although afar off, yet, drawn
by his coursers, the Sun will overtake the poison: the science of
antidotes has converted thee, Poison, to ambrosia.</p>
<p>&lsquo;12. May the thrice-seven sparks of Agni consume the influence
of the venom; they verily do not perish; nor shall we die; for although
afar off, the Sun, drawn by his coursers, will overtake the poison: the
science of antidotes has converted thee, Poison, to ambrosia.</p>
<p>&lsquo;13. I recite the names of ninety and nine rivers, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb350" href="#v1pb350" name=

Sun, drawn by his coursers, will overtake the poison: the science of
antidotes will convert thee, Poison, to ambrosia.</p>
<p>&lsquo;14. May the thrice-seven peahens, the seven-sister rivers,
carry off, O Body, thy poison, as maidens with pitchers carry away
water.</p>
<p>&lsquo;15. May the insignificant mungoose carry off thy venom,
Poison: if not, I will crush the vile creature with a stone: so may the
poison depart from my body, and go to distant regions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;16. Hastening forth at the command of Agastya, thus spake the

<p>Though, in the sixth verse of this hymn, the serpents are said to be
born of Heaven and Earth, the context does not warrant the idea that
any homage to them is intended; they are associated with the evil
Rakshasas, the Sun and Agni being represented as their haters and
destroyers. The seven-sister rivers (streams of the sacred Ganges)
supply an antidote to their venom, and certain animals, the partridge
and the mungoose, are said, though insignificant, to be their
superiors. The science of antidotes alluded to is that which Indra
taught to Dadhyanch, who lost his head for communicating it to the
Aswins. It is notable, however, that in the Vedic period there is
nothing which represents the serpent as medicinal, unless by a
roundabout process we connect the expression in the Rig-Veda that the
wrath of the Maruts, or storm-gods, is &lsquo;as the ire of
serpents,&rsquo; with the fact that their chief, Rudra, is celebrated
as the bestower of &lsquo;healing herbs,&rsquo; and they themselves
solicited for &lsquo;medicaments.&rsquo; This would be stretching the
sense of the hymns too far. It is quite possible, however, that at a
later day, when serpent-worship <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb351"
href="#v1pb351" name="v1pb351">351</a>]</span>was fully developed in
India, what is said in the sixth verse of the hymn may have been
adduced to confirm the superstition.</p>
<p>It seems clear, then, that at the time the <i>Kankato na</i> was
written, the serpent was regarded with simple abhorrence. And we may
remember, also, that even now, when the Indian cobra is revered as a
Brahman of the highest caste, there is a reminiscence of his previous
ill repute preserved in the common Hindu belief that a certain mark on
his head was left there by the heel of Vishnu, Lord of Life, who trod
on it when, in one of his avatars, he first stepped upon the earth.
Although in the later mythology we find Vishnu, in the intervals
between his avatars or incarnations, reposing on a serpent
(<i>Sesha</i>), this might originally have signified only his lordship
over it, though Sesha is also called <i>Ananta</i>, the Infinite. The
idea of the Infinite is a late one, however, and the symbolisation of
it by Sesha is consistent with a lower significance at first. In Hindu
popular fables the snake appears in its simple character. Such is the
fable of which so many variants are found, the most familiar in the
West being that of Bethgelert, and which is the thirteenth of the 4th
Hitopadesa. The Brahman having left his child alone, while he performs
a rite to his ancestors, on his return finds a pet mungoose (nakula)
smeared with blood. Supposing the mungoose has devoured his child, he
slays it, and then discovers that the poor animal had killed a serpent
which had crept upon the infant. In the <i>Kankato na</i> the word
interpreted by S&aacute;yana as mungoose (<i>Viverra Mungo</i>, or
ichneumon) is not the same (<i>nakula</i>), but it evidently means some
animal sufficiently unimportant to cast contempt upon the Serpent.</p>
<p>The universality of the Serpent as emblem of the healing
art&mdash;found as such among the <span class="corr" id="xd20e6871"
title="Source: Egytians">Egyptians</span>, Greeks, Germans, Aztecs, and
natives of Brazil&mdash;suggests that its longevity <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb352" href="#v1pb352" name=
"v1pb352">352</a>]</span>and power of casting its old skin, apparently
renewing its youth, may have been the basis of this reputation. No
doubt, also, they would have been men of scientific tendencies and of
close observation who first learned the snake&rsquo;s susceptibilities
to music, and how its poison might be drawn, or even its fangs, and who
so gained reputation as partakers of its supposed powers. Through such
primitive rationalism the Serpent might gain an important alliance and
climb to make the asp-crown of Isis as goddess of health (the
Thermuthis), to twine round the staff of Esculapius, to be emblem of
Hippocrates, and ultimately survive to be the sign of the European
leech, twining at last as a red stripe round the barber&rsquo;s pole.
The primitive zoologist and snake-charmer would not only, in all
likelihood, be a man cunning in the secrets of nature, but he would
study to meet as far as he could the popular demand for palliatives and
antidotes against snake-bites; all who escaped death after such wounds
would increase his credit as a practitioner; and even were his
mitigations necessarily few, his knowledge of the Serpent&rsquo;s
habits and of its varieties might be the source of valuable
precautions.</p>
<p>Such probable facts as these must, of course, be referred to a
period long anterior to the poetic serpent-symbolism of Egypt, and the
elaborate Serpent mythology of Greece and Scandinavia. How simple
ideas, having once gained popular prestige, may be caught up by
theologians, poets, metaphysicians, and quacks, and modified into
manifold forms, requires no proof in an age when we are witnessing the
rationalistic interpretations by which the cross, the sacraments, and
the other plain symbols are invested with all manner of philosophical
meanings. The Serpent having been adopted as the sign-post of Egyptian
and Assyrian doctors&mdash;and it may have been something of that kind
that was set up by Moses in the wilderness&mdash;would naturally
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb353" href="#v1pb353" name=
"v1pb353">353</a>]</span>become the symbol of life, and after that it
would do duty in any capacity whatever.</p>
<p>An ingenious anthropologist, Mr. C. Staniland Wake,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e6882src" href="#xd20e6882" name="xd20e6882src">2</a>
supposes the Serpent in India to have been there also the symbol of
pr&aelig;ternatural and occult knowledge. Possibly this may have been
so to a limited extent, and in post-Vedic times, but to me the accent
of Hindu serpent-mythology appears to be emphatically in the homage
paid to it as the guardian of the treasures. I may mention here also
the theory propounded by Miss A. W. Buckland in a paper submitted to
the Anthropological Institute in London, March 10, 1874, on &lsquo;The
Serpent in connection with Primitive Metallurgy.&rsquo; In this learned
monograph the writer maintains that a connection may be observed
between the early serpent-worship and a knowledge of metals, and indeed
that the Serpent was the sign of Turanian metallurgists in the same way
as I have suggested that in Egypt and Assyria it was the sign of
physicians. She believes that the Serpent must have played some part in
the original discovery of the metals and precious stones by man, in
recognition of which that animal was first assumed as a totem and
thence became an emblem. She states that traditional and
ornamentational evidences show that the Turanian races were the first
workers in metals, and that they migrated westward, probably from India
to Egypt and Chald&aelig;a, and thence to Europe, and even to America,
bearing their art and its sign; and that they fled before the Aryans,
who had the further art of smelting, and that the Aryan myths of
serpent-slaying record the overthrow of the Turanian
serpent-worshippers.</p>
<p>I cannot think that Miss Buckland has made out a case for crediting
nomadic Turanians with being the original <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb354" href="#v1pb354" name="v1pb354">354</a>]</span>metallurgists;
though it is not impossible that it may have been a Scythian tribe in
Southern India who gave its fame to &lsquo;the gold of Ophir,&rsquo;
which Max M&uuml;ller has shown to have been probably an Indian
region.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6892src" href="#xd20e6892" name=
"xd20e6892src">3</a> But that these early jewellers may have had the
Serpent as their sign or emblem is highly probable, and in explanation
of it there seems little reason to resort to the hypothesis of aid
having been given by the Serpent to man in his discovery of metals.
Surely the jewelled decoration of the serpent would in itself have been
an obvious suggestion of it as the emblem of gems. Where a reptile for
some reasons associated with the snake&mdash;the toad&mdash;had not the
like bright spots, the cognate superstition might arise that its jewel
is concealed in its head. And, finally, when these reptiles had been
connected with gems, the eye of either would easily receive added rays
from manifold eye-beams of superstition.</p>
<p>We might also credit the primitive people with sufficient logical
power to understand why they should infer that an animal so wonderfully
and elaborately provided with deadliness as the Serpent should have
tasks of corresponding importance. The medicine which healed man
(therefore possibly gods), the treasures valued most by men (therefore
by anthropomorphic deities), the fruit of immortality (which the gods
might wish to monopolise),&mdash;might seem the supreme things of
value, which the supreme perfection of the serpent&rsquo;s fang might
be created to guard. This might be so in the heavens as well as in the
world or the underworld. The rainbow was called the &lsquo;Celestial
Serpent&rsquo; in Persia, and the old notion that there is a bag of
gold at the end of it is known to many an English and American
child.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the nature of the original suggestion,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb355" href="#v1pb355" name=
"v1pb355">355</a>]</span>there are definite reasons why, when the
Serpent was caught up to be part of combinations representing a
Principle of Evil, his character as guardian of treasures should become
of great importance. Wealth is the characteristic of the gods of the
Hades, or unseen world beneath the surface of the earth.</p>
<p>In the vast Sinhalese demonology we find the highest class of demons
(dewatawas) described as resident in golden palaces, glittering with
gems, themselves with skins of golden hue, wearing cobras as ornaments,
their king, Wessamony seated on a gem-throne and wielding a golden
sword. Pluto is from the word for wealth (<span class="trans" title=
"ploutos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&pi;&lambda;&omicron;&#8166;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>),
as also is his Latin name Dis (<i>dives</i>). For such are lords of all
beneath the sod, or the sea&rsquo;s surface. Therefore, it is important
to observe, they own all the seeds in the earth so long as they remain
seeds. So soon as they spring to flower, grain, fruitage, they belong
not to the gods of Hades but to man: an idea which originated the myth
of Persephone, and seems to survive in a school of extreme vegetarians,
who refuse to eat vegetables not ripened in the sun.</p>
<p>These considerations may enable us the better to apprehend the
earlier characters of Ahi, the Throttler, and Vritra, the Coverer. As
guardians of such hidden treasures as metals and drugs the Serpent
might be baroneted and invoked to bestow favours; but those particular
serpents which by hiding away the cloud-cows withheld the rain, or
choked the rivers with drought, all to keep under-world garners fat and
those of the upper world lean, were to be combated. Against them man
invoked the celestial deities, reminding them that their own altars
must lack offerings if they did not vanquish these thievish Binders and
Concealers.</p>
<p>The Serpent with its jewelled raiment, its self-renovating power,
and its matchless accomplishments for lurking, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb356" href="#v1pb356" name=
"v1pb356">356</a>]</span>hiding, fatally striking, was gradually
associated with undulations of rivers and sea-waves on the earth, with
the Milky-way, with &lsquo;coverers&rsquo; of the sky&mdash;night and
cloud&mdash;above all, with the darting, crooked, fork-tongued
lightning. It may have been the lightning that was the Amrita churned
out of the azure sea in the myth of the
&lsquo;Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata,&rsquo; when the gods and demons
turned the mountain with a huge serpent for cord (p. 59), meaning the
descent of fire, or its discovery; but other fair and fruitful things
emerged also,&mdash;the goddess of wine, the cow of plenty, the tree of
heaven. The inhabitants of Burmah still have a custom of pulling at a
rope to produce rain. A rain party and a drought party tug against each
other, the rain party being allowed the victory, which, in the popular
notion is generally followed by rain. I have often seen snakes hung up
after being killed to bring rain, in the State of Virginia. For there
also rain means wealth. It is there believed also that, however much it
may be crushed, a snake will not die entirely until it thunders. These
are distant echoes of the Vedic sentences. &lsquo;Friend Vishnu,&rsquo;
says Indra, &lsquo;stride vastly; sky give room for the thunderbolt to
strike; let us slay Vritra and let loose the waters.&rsquo;
&lsquo;When, Thunderer, thou didst by thy might slay Vritra, who
stopped up the streams, then thy dear steeds grew.<span class="corr"
id="xd20e6920" title="Source: &rdquo;">&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>Vritra, though from the same root as Varuna (the sky), means at
first a coverer of the sky&mdash;cloud or darkness; hence eventually he
becomes the hider, the thief, who steals and conceals the bounties of
heaven&mdash;a rainless cloud, a suffocating night; and eventually
Vritra coalesces with the most fearful phantasm of the Aryan
mind&mdash;the serpent Ahi.</p>
<p>The Greek word for Adder, <span class="trans" title=
"echis"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&#7956;&chi;&iota;&sigmaf;</span></span>, is a modification of
Ahi. Perhaps there exists no more wonderful example <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb357" href="#v1pb357" name=
"v1pb357">357</a>]</span>of the unconscious idealism of human nature
than the history of the name of the great Throttler, as it has been
traced by Professor Max M&uuml;ller. The Serpent was also called
<i>ahi</i> in Sanskrit, in Greece <i>echis</i> or <i>echidna</i>, in
Latin <i lang="la">anguis</i>. The root is <i>ah</i> in Sanskrit, or
<i>amh</i>, which means to press together, to choke, to throttle. It is
a curious root this <i>amh</i>, and it still lives in several modern
words, In Latin it appears as <i lang="la">ango, anxi, anctum</i>, to
strangle; in <i>angina</i>, quinsy; in <i>angor</i>, suffocation. But
<i>angor</i> meant not only quinsy or compression of the neck: it
assumed a moral import, and signifies anguish or anxiety. The two
adjectives <i>angustus</i>, narrow, and <i>anxius</i>, uneasy, both
came from the same root. In Greek the root retained its natural and
material meaning; in <i>eggys</i>, near, and <i>echis</i>, serpent,
throttler. But in Sanskrit it was chosen with great truth as the proper
name of sin. Evil no doubt presented itself under various aspects to
the human mind, and its names are many; but none so expressive as those
derived from our root <i>amh</i>, to throttle. <i>Amhas</i> in Sanskrit
means sin, but it does so only because it meant originally
throttling&mdash;the consciousness of sin being like the grasp of the
assassin on the throat of the victim. All who have seen and
contemplated the statue of Laokoon and his sons, with the serpent
coiled around them from head to foot, may realise what those ancients
felt and saw when they called sin <i>amhas</i>, or the throttler. This
<i>amhas</i> is the same as the Greek <i>agos</i>, sin. In Gothic the
same root has produced <i>agis</i>, in the sense of fear, and from the
same source we have <i>awe</i>, in <i>awful</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, fearful,
and <i>ug</i> in <i>ugly</i>. The English <i>anguish</i> is from the
French <i>angoise</i>, a corruption of the Latin
<i>angustit&aelig;</i>, a strait.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7029src"
href="#xd20e7029" name="xd20e7029src">4</a> In this wonderful history
of a word, whose biography, as Max M&uuml;ller in his Hibbert Lectures
said of <i>Deva</i>, might fill a volume, may also <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb358" href="#v1pb358" name=
"v1pb358">358</a>]</span>be included our <i>ogre</i>, and also the
German <i lang="de">unke</i>, which means a &lsquo;frog&rsquo; or
&lsquo;toad,&rsquo; but originally a
&lsquo;snake&rsquo;&mdash;especially the little house-snake which plays
a large part in Teutonic folklore, and was supposed to bring good
luck.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7044src" href="#xd20e7044" name=
"xd20e7044src">5</a></p>
<p>This euphemistic variant is, however, the only exception I can find
to the baleful branches into which the root <i>ah</i> has grown through
the world; one of its fearful fruits being the accompanying figure,
copied from one of the ornamental bosses of Wells Cathedral.</p>

<p>The Adder demon has been universal. Herodotus relates that from a
monster, half-woman, half-serpent, sprang the Scythians, and the fable
has often been remembered in the history of the Turks. The
&lsquo;Zoh&aacute;k&rsquo; of Firdusi is the Iranian form of Ahi. The
name is the Arabicised form of the &lsquo;Azhi Dah&aacute;ka&rsquo; of
the Avesta, the &lsquo;baneful serpent&rsquo; vanquished by
Thra&ecirc;taono (Traitana of the Vedas), and this Iranian name again
(D&aacute;saka) is Ahi. The name reappears in the Median
Astyages.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7062src" href="#xd20e7062" name=
"xd20e7062src">6</a> Zoh&aacute;k is represented as having two serpents
growing out of his shoulders, which the late Professor Wilson supposed
might have been suggested by a phrase in the <i>Kankato na</i> (ye
ansy&aacute; ye angy&aacute;h) which he translates, &lsquo;Those who
move with their shoulders, those who move with their bodies,&rsquo;
which, however, may mean &lsquo;those produced on the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb359" href="#v1pb359" name=
"v1pb359">359</a>]</span>shoulders, biting with them,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;might furnish those who seek for analogies between Iranian and
Indian legends with a parallel in the story of Zoh&aacute;k.&rsquo; The
legend alluded to is a favourite one in Persia, where it is used to
point a moral, as in the instruction of the learned Saib to the Prince,
his pupil. Saib related to the boy the story of King Zoh&aacute;k, to
whom a magician came, and, breathing on him, caused two serpents to
come forth from the region of his breast, and told him they would bring
him great glory and pleasure, provided he would feed these serpents
with the poorest of his subjects. This Zoh&aacute;k did; and he had
great pleasure and wealth until his subjects revolted and shut the King
up in a cavern where he became himself a prey to the two serpents. The
young Prince to whom this legend was related was filled with horror,
and begged Saib to tell him a pleasanter one. The teacher then related
that a young Sultan placed his confidence in an artful courtier who
filled his mind with false notions of greatness and happiness, and
introduced into his heart Pride and Voluptuousness. To those two
passions the young Sultan sacrificed the interests of his kingdom,
until his subjects banished him; but his Pride and Voluptuousness
remained in him, and, unable to gratify them in his exile, he died of
rage and despair. The prince-pupil said, &lsquo;I like this story
better than the other.&rsquo; &lsquo;And yet,&rsquo; said Saib,
&lsquo;it is the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is curious that this old Persian fable should have survived in
the witch-lore of America, and at last supplied Nathaniel Hawthorne
with the theme of one of his beautiful allegorical
romances,&mdash;that, namely, of the man with a snake in his bosom
which ever threatened to throttle him if he did not feed it. It came to
the American fabulist through many a mythical skin, so to say. One of
the most beautiful it has worn is a story which is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb360" href="#v1pb360" name=
"v1pb360">360</a>]</span>still told by mothers to their children in
some districts of Germany. It relates that a little boy and girl went
into the fields to gather strawberries. After they had gathered they
met an aged woman, who asked for some of the fruit. The little girl
emptied her basket into the old woman&rsquo;s lap; but the boy clutched
his, and said he wanted his berries for himself. When they had passed
on the old woman called them back, and presented to each a little box.
The girl opened hers, and found in it two white caterpillars which
speedily became butterflies, then grew to be angels with golden wings,
and bore her away to Paradise. The boy opened his box, and from it
issued two tiny black worms; these swiftly swelled to huge serpents,
which, twining all about the boy&rsquo;s limbs, drew him away into the
dark forest; where this Teutonic Laokoon still remains to illustrate in
his helplessness the mighty power of little faults to grow into bad
habits and bind the whole man. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb361"

<p class="first">A Dragoon once presented himself before Frederick the
Great and offered the king a small pebble, which, he said, had been cut
from the head of a king-snake, and would no doubt preserve the throne.
Frederick probably trusted more to dragoons than dragons, but he kept
the little curiosity, little knowing, perhaps, that it would be as
prolific of legends as the cock&rsquo;s egg, to which it is popularly
traceable, in cockatrices (whose name may have given rise to the
cock-fables) or basilisks. It has now taken its place in German
folklore that Frederick owed his greatness to a familiar kept near him
in the form of a basilisk. But there are few parts of the world where
similar legends might not spring up and coil round any famous
reputation. An Indian newspaper, the <i>Lawrence Gazette</i>, having
mentioned that the ex-king of Oudh is a collector of snakes,
adds&mdash;&lsquo;Perhaps he wishes to become possessed of the precious
jewel which some serpents are said to contain, or of that species of
snake by whose means, it is said, a person can fly in the air.&rsquo;
Dr. Dennys, in whose work on Chinese Folklore this is quoted, finds the
same notion in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb362" href="#v1pb362"
name="v1pb362">362</a>]</span>China. In one story a foreigner
repeatedly tries to purchase a butcher&rsquo;s bench, but the butcher
refuses to sell it, suspecting there must be some hidden value in the
article; for this reason he puts the bench by, and when the foreigner
returns a year afterwards, learns from him that lodged in the bench was
a snake, kept alive by the blood soaking through it, which held a
precious gem in its mouth&mdash;quite worthless after the snake was
dead. Cursing his stupidity at having put the bench out of use, the
butcher cut it open and found the serpent dead, holding in its mouth
something like the eye of a dried fish.</p>
<p>Here we have two items which may only be accidental, and yet, on the
other hand, possibly possess significance. The superior knowledge about
the serpent attributed to a &lsquo;foreigner&rsquo; may indicate that
such stories in China are traditionally alien, imported with the
Buddhists; and the comparison of the dead gem to an eye may add a
little to the probabilities that this magical jewel, whether in head of
toad or serpent, is the reptile&rsquo;s eye as seen by the glamour of
human eyes. The eye of the basilisk is at once its wealth-producing,
its fascinating, and its paralysing talisman, though all these beliefs
have their various sources and their several representations in
mythology. That it was seen as a gem was due, as I think, to the
jewelled skin of most serpents, which gradually made them symbols of
riches; that it was believed able to fascinate may be attributed to the
general principles of illusion already considered; but its paralysing
power, its evil eye, connects it with a notion, found alike in Egypt
and India, that the serpent kills with its eye. Among Sanskrit words
for serpent are &lsquo;<i>drig-visha</i>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<i>drishti-visha</i>&rsquo;&mdash;literally &lsquo;having poison
in the eye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While all serpents were lords and guardians of wealth, certain of
them were crested, or had small horns, which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb363" href="#v1pb363" name=
"v1pb363">363</a>]</span>conveyed the idea of a crowned and imperial
snake, the <span class="trans" title="basiliskos"><span class="Greek"
lang=
"el">&beta;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&lambda;&#8055;&sigma;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>.
Naturalists have recognised this origin of the name by giving the same
(<i>Basiliscus mitratus</i>) to a genus of <span class="corr" id=
"xd20e7114" title="Source: Inguanid&aelig;">Iguanid&aelig;</span>,
remarkable for a membranous crest not only on the occiput but also
along the back, which this lizard can raise and depress at pleasure.
But folklore, the science of the ignorant, had established the same
connection by alleging that the basilisk is hatched from the egg of a
black cock,&mdash;which was the peasant&rsquo;s explanation of the word
cockatrice. De Plancy traces one part of the belief to a disease which
causes the cock to produce a small egg-like substance; but the
resemblance between its comb and the crests of serpent and
frog<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7117src" href="#xd20e7117" name=
"xd20e7117src">1</a> was the probable link between them; while the
ancient eminence of the cock as the bird of dawn relegated the origin
of the basilisk to a very exceptional member of the family&mdash;a
black cock in its seventh year. The useful fowl would seem, however, to
have suffered even so slightly mainly through a phonetic misconception.
The word &lsquo;cockatrice&rsquo; is &lsquo;crocodile&rsquo;
transformed. We have it in the Old French &lsquo;cocatrix,&rsquo; which
again is from the Spanish &lsquo;cocotriz,&rsquo; meaning
&lsquo;crocodile,&rsquo;&mdash;<span class="trans" title=
"krokodeilos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&kappa;&rho;&omicron;&kappa;&omicron;&delta;&epsilon;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>;
which Herodotus, by the way, uses to denote a kind of lizard, and whose
sanctity has extended from the Nile to the Danube, where folklore
declares that the skeleton of the lizard presents an image of the
passion of Christ, and it must never be harmed. Thus
&lsquo;cockatrice&rsquo; has nothing to do with &lsquo;cock&rsquo; or
&lsquo;coq,&rsquo; though possibly the coincidence of the sound has
marred the ancient fame of the &lsquo;Bird of Dawn.&rsquo; Indeed black
cocks have been so generally slain on this account that they were for a
long time rare, and so the basilisks had a chance of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb364" href="#v1pb364" name=
"v1pb364">364</a>]</span>becoming extinct. There were fabulous
creatures enough, however, to perpetuate the basilisk&rsquo;s imaginary
powers, some of which will be hereafter considered. We may devote the
remainder of this chapter to the consideration of a variant of
dragon-mythology, which must be cleared out of our way in apprehending
the Dragon. This is the agathodemonic or heraldic Dragon, which has
inherited the euphemistic characters of the treasure-guarding and
crowned serpent.</p>
<p>In Slavonic legend the king-serpent plays a large part, and
innumerable stories relate the glories of some peasant child that,
managing to secure a tiny gem from his crown, while the reptilian
monarch was bathing, found the jewel daily surrounded with new
treasures. This is the same serpent which, gathering up the myths of
lightning and of comets, flies through many German legends as the red
Drake, Kolbuk, Alp, or Alberflecke, dropping gold when it is red, corn
if blue, and yielding vast services and powers to those who can
magically master it. The harmless serpents of Germany were universally
invested with agathodemonic functions, though they still bear the name
that relates them to Ahi, viz., <i>unken</i>. Of these household-snakes
Grimm and Simrock give much information. It is said that in fields and
houses they approach solitary children and drink milk from the dish
with them. On their heads they wear golden crowns, which they lay down
before drinking, and sometimes forget when they retire. They watch over
children in the cradle, and point out to their favourites where
treasures are hidden. To kill them brings misfortune. If the parents
surprise the snake with the child and kill it, the child wastes away.
Once the snake crept into the mouth of a pregnant woman, and when the
child was born the snake was found closely coiled around its neck, and
could only be untwined by a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb365"
href="#v1pb365" name="v1pb365">365</a>]</span>milk-bath; but it never
left the child&rsquo;s side, ate and slept with it, and never did it
harm. If such serpents left a house or farm, prosperity went with them.
In some regions it is said a male and female snake appear whenever the
master or mistress of the house is about to die, and the legends of the
<i>Unken</i> sometimes relapse into the original fear out of which they
grew. Indeed, their vengeance is everywhere much dreaded, while their
gratitude, especially for milk, is as imperishable as might be expected
from their ancestor&rsquo;s quarrel with Indra about the stolen cows.
In the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i> it is related that a milkmaid was
regularly approached at milking-time by a large snake to which she gave
milk. The maid having left her place, her successor found on the
milking-stool a golden crown, on which was inscribed &lsquo;In
Gratitude.&rsquo; The crown was sent to the milkmaid who had gone, but
from that time the snake was never seen again.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7144src" href="#xd20e7144" name="xd20e7144src">2</a></p>
<p>In England serpents were mastered by the vows of a saintly
Christian. The Knight Bran in the Isle of Wight is said to have picked
up the cockatrice egg, to have been pursued by the serpents, which he
escaped by vowing to build St. Lawrence Church in that
island,&mdash;the egg having afterwards brought him endless wealth and
uniform success in combat. With the manifold fables concerning the
royal dragon would seem to blend traditions of the astrological,
celestial, and lightning serpents. But these would coincide with a
development arising from the terrestrial worms and their heroic
slayers. The demonic dragon with his terrible eye might discern from
afar the advent of his predestined destroyer. It might seek to devour
him in infancy. As the comet might be deemed a portent of some powerful
prince born on earth, so it might be a compliment to a royal family, on
the birth of a prince, to report <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb366"
href="#v1pb366" name="v1pb366">366</a>]</span>that a dragon had been
seen. Nor would it be a long step from this office of the dragon as the
herald of greatness to placing that monster on banners. From these
banners would grow sagas of dragons encountered and slain. The devices
might thus multiply. Some process of this kind would account for the
entirely good reputation of the dragon in China and Japan, where it is
the emblem of all national grandeur. It would also appear to underlie
the proud titles of the Pythian Apollo and Bellerophon, gained from the
monsters they were said to have slain. The city of Worms takes its name
from the serpent instead of its slayer.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7151src" href="#xd20e7151" name="xd20e7151src">3</a> Pendragon,
in the past&mdash;and even our dragoon of the present&mdash;are names
in which the horrors of the monster become transformed in the
hero&rsquo;s fame. The dragon, says Mr. Hardwicke, was the standard of
the West Saxons, and of the English previous to the Norman Conquest. It
formed one of the supporters of the royal arms borne by all the Tudor
monarchs, with the exception of Queen Mary, who substituted the eagle.
Several of the Plantagenet kings and princes inscribed a figure of the
dragon on their banners and shields. Peter Langtoffe says, at the
battle of Lewis, fought in 1264, &lsquo;The king schewed forth his
schild, his dragon full austere.&rsquo; Another authority says the said
king (Henry III.) ordered to be made &lsquo;a dragon in the manner of a
banner, of a certain red silk embroidered with gold; its tongue like a
flaming fire must always seem to be moving; its eyes must be made of
sapphire, or of some other stone suitable for that
purpose.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7154src" href="#xd20e7154"
name="xd20e7154src">4</a></p>
<p>It will thus be seen that an influence has been introduced into
dragon-lore which has no relation whatever to the demon itself. This
will explain those variants of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb367" href="#v1pb367" name="v1pb367">367</a>]</span>legend of
Melusina&mdash;the famous woman-serpent&mdash;which invest her with
romance. Melusina, whose indiscreet husband glanced at her in forbidden
hours, when she was in her serpent shape, was long the glory of the
Chateau de Lusignan, where her cries announced the approaching death of
her descendants. There is a peasant family still dwelling in
Fontainebleau Forest who claim to be descended from Melusina; and
possibly some instance of this kind may have dropped like a seed into
the memory of the author of &lsquo;Elsie Venner&rsquo; to reappear in
one of the finest novels of our generation. The corresponding sentiment
is found surrounding the dragon in the familiar British legend of the
Laidley<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7161src" href="#xd20e7161" name=
"xd20e7161src">5</a> Worm. The king of Northumberland brought home a
new Queen, who was also a sorceress, and being envious of the beauty of
her step-daughter, changed that poor princess into the worm which
devastated all Spindleton Heugh. For seven miles every green thing was
blighted by its venom, and seven cows had to yield their daily supplies
of milk. Meanwhile the king and his son mourned the disappearance of
the princess. The young prince fitted out a ship to go and slay the
dragon. The wicked Queen tries unsuccessfully to prevent the
expedition. The prince leaps from his ship into the shallow sea, and
wades to the rock around which the worm lay coiled. But as he drew near
the monster said to him:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Oh, quit thy sword, and bend thy bow,</p>
<p class="line xd20e3317">And give me kisses three;</p>
<p class="line">If I&rsquo;m not won ere the sun goes down,</p>
<p class="line xd20e3317">Won I shall never be.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">He quitted his sword and bent his bow,</p>
<p class="line xd20e3317">He gave her kisses three;</p>
<p class="line">She crept into a hole a worm,</p>
<p class="line xd20e3317">But out stept a ladye.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb368" href="#v1pb368" name=
"v1pb368">368</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the end the prince managed to have the wicked Queen transformed
into a toad, which in memory thereof, as every Northumbrian boy knows,
spits fire to this day: but it is notable that the sorceress was
<i>not</i> transformed into a dragon, as the story would probably have
run if the dragon form had not already been detached from its original
character, and by many noble associations been rendered an honourable
though fearful shape for maidens like this princess and like
Melusina.</p>
<p>In the same direction point the legends which show dragons as
sometimes victorious over their heroic assailants. Geoffrey of Monmouth
so relates of King Morvidus of Northumbria, who encountered a dragon
that came from the Irish Sea, and was last seen disappearing in the
monster&rsquo;s jaws &lsquo;like a small fish.&rsquo; A more famous
instance is that of Beowulf, whose Anglo-Saxon saga is summed up by
Professor Morley as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;Afterward the broad land came
under the sway of Beowulf. He held it well for fifty winters, until in
the dark night a dragon, which in a stone mound watched a hoard of gold
and cups, won mastery. It was a hoard heaped up in sin, its lords were
long since dead; the last earl before dying hid it in the earth-cave,
and for three hundred winters the great scather held the cave, until
some man, finding by chance a rich cup, took it to his lord. Then the
den was searched while the worm slept; again and again when the dragon
awoke there had been theft. He found not the man but wasted the whole
land with fire; nightly the fiendish air-flyer made fire grow hateful
to the sight of men. Then it was told to Beowulf.... He sought out the
dragon&rsquo;s den and fought with him in awful strife. One wound the
poison-worm struck in the flesh of Beowulf.&rsquo; Whereof Beowulf
died.</p>
<p>Equally significant is the legend that when King Arthur <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb369" href="#v1pb369" name=
"v1pb369">369</a>]</span>had embarked at Southampton on his expedition
against Rome, about midnight he saw in a dream &lsquo;a bear flying in
the air, at the noise of which all the shores trembled; also a terrible
dragon, flying from the west, which enlightened the country with the
brightness of its eyes. When these two met they had a dreadful fight,
but the dragon with its fiery breath burned the bear which assaulted
him, and threw him down scorched to the earth.&rsquo; This vision was
taken to augur Arthur&rsquo;s victory. The father of Arthur had already
in a manner consecrated the symbol, being named Uther Pendragon
(dragon&rsquo;s head). On the death of his brother Aurelius, it was
told &lsquo;there appeared a star of wonderful magnitude and
brightness,&rsquo; darting forth a ray, at the end of which was a globe
of fire, in form of a dragon, out of whose mouth issued two rays, one
of which seemed to stretch out itself towards the Irish Sea, and ended
in seven lesser rays.&rsquo; Merlin interpreted this phenomenon to mean
that Uther would be made king and conquer various regions; and after
his first victory Uther had two golden dragons made, one of which he
presented to Winchester Cathedral, retaining the other to attend him in
his wars.</p>
<p>In the legend of Merlin and Vortigern we find the Dragon so
completely developed into a merely warrior-like symbol that its moral
character has to be determined by its colour. As in the two armies of
serpents seen by Zoroaster, in Persian legends, which fought in the
air, the victory of the white over the black foreshowing the triumph of
Ormuzd over Ahriman, the tyranny of Vortigern is represented by a red
dragon, while Aurelius and Uther are the two heads of a white dragon.
Merlin, about to be buried alive, in pursuance of the
astrologer&rsquo;s declaration to Vortigern that so only would his
ever-falling wall stand firm, had revealed that the recurring disaster
was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb370" href="#v1pb370" name=
"v1pb370">370</a>]</span>caused by the struggle of these two dragons
underground. When the monsters were unearthed they fought terribly,
until the white one</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Hent the red with all his might,</p>
<p class="line">And to the ground he him cast,</p>
<p class="line">And, with the fire of his blast,</p>
<p class="line">Altogether brent the red,</p>
<p class="line">That never of him was founden shred;</p>
<p class="line">But dust upon the ground he lay.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The white dragon vanished and was seen no more; but
the tyrant Vortigern fulfilled the fate of the red dragon, being burnt
in his castle near Salisbury. These two dragons met again, however, as
red and white roses.</p>
<p>Many developments corresponding to these might be cited. One indeed
bears a startling resemblance to our English legends. Of King Nuat
Meiamoun, whose conquest of Egypt is placed by G. Maspero about B.C.
664&ndash;654, the Ethiopian &lsquo;Stele of the Dream&rsquo;
relates:&mdash;&lsquo;His Majesty beheld a dream in the night, two
snakes, one to his right, the other to his left, (and) when His Majesty
awoke ... he said: &lsquo;Explain these things to me on the
moment,&rsquo; and lo! they explained it to him, saying: &lsquo;Thou
wilt have the Southern lands, and seize the Northern, and the two
crowns will be put on thy head, (for) there is given unto thee the
earth in all its width and its breadth.&rsquo; These two snakes were
probably suggested by the <i>ur&aelig;i</i> of the Egyptian diadem.</p>
<p>Beyond the glory reflected upon a monster from his conqueror, there
would be reason why the alchemist and the wizard should encourage that
aspect of the dragon. The more perilous that Gorgon whose blood
Esculapius used, the more costly such medicament; while, that the
remedy may be advantageous, the monster must not be wholly destructive.
This is so with the now destructive <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb371" href="#v1pb371" name="v1pb371">371</a>]</span>now
preservative forces of nature, and how they may blend in the theories,
and subserve the interests, of pretenders is well shown in a German
work on Alchemy (1625) quoted by Mr. Hardwicke. &lsquo;There is a
dragon lives in the forest, who has no want of poison; when he sees the
sun or fire he spits venom, which flies about fearfully. No living
animal can be cured of it; even the basilisk does not equal him. He who
can properly kill this serpent has overcome all his danger. His colours
increase in death; physic is produced from his poison, which he
entirely consumes, and eats his own venomous tail. This must be
accomplished by him, in order to produce the noblest balm. Such great
virtue as we will point out herein that all the learned shall
rejoice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It will be readily understood that these traditions and fables would
combine to &lsquo;hedge about a king&rsquo; by ascribing to him
familiarity with a monster so formidable to common people, and even
investing him with its attributes. The dragon&rsquo;s name,
<span class="trans" title="drak&#333;n"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&delta;&rho;&#8049;&kappa;&#8182;&nu;</span></span>, derived from
the Sanskrit word for serpent (<i>d&#7771;ig-visha</i>), came to mean
&lsquo;the thing that sees.&rsquo; While this gave rise to many legends
of pr&aelig;ternatural powers of vision gained by tasting or bathing in
a dragon&rsquo;s blood, as in the poem of Siegfried; or from waters it
guarded, as &lsquo;Eye Well,&rsquo; in which Guy&rsquo;s dragon dipped
its tail to recover from wounds; the Sanskrit sense of eye-poisoning
was preserved in legends of occult and dangerous powers possessed by
kings,&mdash;one of the latest being the potent evil eye popularly
ascribed in Italy to the late Pius IX. But these stories are endless;
the legends adduced will show the sense of all those which, if
unexplained, might interfere with our clear insight into the dragon
itself, whose further analysis will prove it to be wholly
bad,&mdash;the concentrated terrors of nature. <span class=

Dragons&mdash;Cloud-phantoms&mdash;Paradise and the
Snake&mdash;Prometheus and Jove&mdash;Art and Nature&mdash;Dragon
forms: Anglo-Saxon, Italian, Egyptian, Greek, German&mdash;The modern
conventional Dragon.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The etymologies of the words Dragon and Ophis given in
the preceding chapter, ideally the same, both refer to powers of the
serpent which it does not possess in nature,&mdash;the
pr&aelig;ternatural vision and the glance that kills. The real nature
of the snake is thus overlaid; we have now to deal with the creation of
another world.</p>
<p>There are various conventionalised types of the Dragon, but through
them all one feature is constant,&mdash;the idealised serpent. Its
presence is the demonic or supernatural sign. The heroic dragon-slayer
must not be supposed to have wrestled with mere flesh and blood, in
whatever powerful form. The combat which immortalises him is waged with
all the pains and terrors of earth and heaven concentrated and combined
in one fearful form.</p>
<p>Impossible and phantasmal as was this form in nature, its mystical
meaning in the human mind was terribly real. It was this Eye of
anti-human nature which filled man with dismay, and conjured up the
typical phantom. It was this Pain, purposed and purposing, the Agony of
far-searching vision, subtlest skill, silently creeping, winged,
adapted to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb373" href="#v1pb373" name=
"v1pb373">373</a>]</span>meet his every device with a cleverer device,
which gradually impressed mankind with belief in a general principle of
antagonism to human happiness.</p>
<p>It is only as a combination that any dragon form is miraculous.
Every constituent feature and factor of it is in nature, but here they
are rolled together in one pandemonic expression and terror. Yet no
such form loses its relations with nature: it is lightning and tempest,
fever-bearing malaria and fire, venom and fang, slime and jungle, all
the ferocities of the earth, air, and heavens, gathering to their fatal
artistic force, and waylaying man at every step in his advance. In
Turner&rsquo;s picture of Apollo slaying the Python there is a
marvellous suggestion of the natural conceptions from which the dragon
was evolved. The fearful folds of the monster, undulating with mound
and rock on which he lies, at points almost blend with tangle of bushes
and the jagged chaos amid which he stretches. The hard, wild, cruel
aspects of inanimate nature seem here and there rankly swelling to
horrible life, as yet but half-distinguishable from the stony-hearted
matrix; the crag begins to coil and quiver, the jungle puts forth in
claws; but above all appear the monstrous EYES, in which the forces of
pain, hardship, obstacle have at last acquired purpose and direction.
The god confronts them with eyes yet keener; his arrow, feathered with
eyebeams, has reached its mark, straight between the monster&rsquo;s
eyes; but there is no more anger in his face than might mar the calm
strength of a gardener clearing away the stone and thicket that make
the constituent parts of Python.</p>
<p>If we turn now to the neighbouring picture in the National Gallery
by the same artist, the Hesperian Gardens and their Guard, we behold
the Dragon on his high crag outlining and vitalising not only the edge
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb374" href="#v1pb374" name=
"v1pb374">374</a>]</span>rock but also the sky it meets. His breath
steams up into cloud. The heavens also have their terrors, which take
on eyes and coils. On the line of the horizon were hung the pictures of
the primitive art-gallery. Imagination painted them with brush dipped
now in blackness of the storm, now in fires of the lightning or the
sunset, but the forms were born of experience, of earthly struggle,
defeat, and victory.</p>
<p>As I write these words, I lay aside my pen to look across a little
lake amid the lonely hills of Wales to a sunset which is flooding the
sky with glory. Through the almost greenish sky the wind is bearing
fantastic clouds, that sometimes take the shape of chariots, in which
cloud-veiled forms are seated, and now great birds with variegated
plumage, all hastening as it were to some gathering-place of aerial
gods. Beneath a long bar of maroon-tint stretches a sea of yellow
light, on the hither side of which is set a garden of fleecy trees
touched with golden fruit. Amid them plays a fountain of changing
colours. On the left has stood, fast as a mountain range, a mass of
dark-blue cloud with uneven peaks; suddenly a pink faint glow shines
from behind that leaden mass, and next appears, sinuous with its long
indented top, the mighty folds of a fiery serpent. Nay, its head is
seen, its yawning lacertine jaws, its tinted crest. It is sleepless
Ladon on his high barrier keeping watch and ward over the Hesperian
garden.</p>
<p>Juno set him there, but he is the son of Ge,&mdash;the earth. The
tints of heaven invest and transform, and in a sense create him; but he
would never have been born mythologically had it not been that in this
world stings hover near all sweetness, danger environs beauty, and, as
Plato said, &lsquo;Good things come hard.&rsquo; The grace and lustre
of the serpent with his fatal fang preceded him, and all the perils
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb375" href="#v1pb375" name=
"v1pb375">375</a>]</span>that lurk beneath things fair and fascinating.
So far there is nothing essentially moral or unmoral about him. This
dragon is a shape designed by primitive meteorology and metaphysics
together. Man has asked what is so, and this is the answer: he has not
yet asked why it is so, whether it ought to be so, and whether it may
not be otherwise. The challenge has not yet been given, the era of
combat not yet arrived. The panoplied guard and ally of gods as unmoral
as himself has yet to be transformed under the touch of the religious
sentiment, and expelled from the heaven of nobler deities as a dragon
cast down, deformed, and degraded for ever.</p>
<p>As thought goes on, such allies compromise their employers; the
creator&rsquo;s work reflects the creator&rsquo;s character; and after
many timorous ages we find the dragon-guarded deities going down with
their cruel defenders. It is not without significance that in the
Sanskrit dictionary the most ancient of all words for god,
<i>Asura</i>, has for its primary meaning &lsquo;demon&rsquo; or
&lsquo;devil:&rsquo; the gods and dragons united to churn the ocean for
their own wealth, and in the end they were tarred with one brush. I
have already described in the beginning of this work the degradation of
deities, and need here barely recall to the reader&rsquo;s memory the
forces which operated to that result. The bearing of that force upon
the celestial or paradise-guarding Serpent is summed up in one quatrain
of Omar Khayy&aacute;m:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">O Thou who man of baser earth didst make,</p>
<p class="line xd20e3317">And e&rsquo;en in Paradise devised the
Snake;</p>
<p class="line xd20e3317">For all the sin wherewith the face of man</p>
<p class="line">Is blackened, man&rsquo;s forgiveness give&mdash;and
take!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The heart of humanity anticipated its logic by many
ages, and, long before the daring genius of the Persian poet wrote this
immortal epitaph on the divine allies of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb376" href="#v1pb376" name=
"v1pb376">376</a>]</span>Serpent, heroes had given battle to the whole
fraternity. Nay, in their place had arisen a new race of gods, whose
theoretical omnipotence was gladly surrendered in the interest of their
righteousness; and there was now war in heaven; the dragon and his
allies were cast down, and man was now free to fight them as enemies of
the gods as well as himself. Woe henceforth to any gods suspected of
taking sides with the dragon in this man&rsquo;s life-and-death
struggle with the ferocities of nature, and with his own terrors
reflected from them! The legend of Prometheus was their
unconsciously-given &lsquo;notice to quit,&rsquo; though it waited many
centuries for its great interpreter. It is Goethe who alone has seen

<p>The dragon forms which have become familiar to us through
medi&aelig;val and modern iconography are of comparatively little
importance as illustrating the social or spiritual conditions out of
which they grew, and of which they became emblems. They long ago ceased
to be descriptive, and in the rude periods or places a very few
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb379" href="#v1pb379" name=
"v1pb379">379</a>]</span>scratches were sometimes enough to indicate
the dragon; such mere suggestions in the end allowing large freedom to
subsequent designers in varying original types.</p>

<p>As to external form, the various shapes of the more primitive
dragons have been largely determined by the mythologic currents amid
which they have fallen, though their original basis in nature may
generally be traced. In the far North, where the legends of
swan-maidens, pigeon-maidens, and vampyres were paramount in the Middle
Ages, we find the bird-shaped dragon very common. Sometimes the
serpent-characteristics are pronounced, as in this ancient French
Swan-Dragon (<a href="#v1fig26">Fig. 26</a>); but, again, and
especially in regions where serpents are rare and comparatively
innocuous, the serpent tail is often conventionalised away, as in this
initial V from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb380" href=
"#v1pb380" name="v1pb380">380</a>]</span>C&aelig;dmon Manuscript, tenth
century (<a href="#v1fig27">Fig. 27</a>), a fair example of the
ornamental Anglo-Saxon dragon. The cuttlefish seems to have suggested
the animalised form of the Hydra, which in turn helped to shape the
Dragon of the Apocalypse. Yet the Hydra in pictorial representation
appears to have been influenced by Assyrian ideas; for although the
monster had nine heads, it is often given seven (number of the Hathors,
or Fates) by the engravers, as in <a href="#v1fig6">Fig. 6</a>. The
conflicts of Hercules with the Hydra repeated that of Bel with Tiamat
(&lsquo;the Deep&rsquo;), and had no doubt its counterpart in that of
Michael with the Dragon,&mdash;the finest representation of which,
perhaps, is the great fresco by Spinello (fourteenth century) at
Arezzo, a group from which is presented in <a href="#v1fig28">Fig.
28</a>. In this case the wings represent those always attributed in
Semitic mythology to the Destroying Angel. The Egyptian Dragon, of
which the crocodile is the basis, at an early period entered into
christian symbolism, and gradually effaced most of the pagan monsters.
The crocodile and the alligator, besides being susceptible of many
horrible variations <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb381" href=
"#v1pb381" name="v1pb381">381</a>]</span>in pictorial treatment, were
particularly acceptable to the Christian propaganda, because of the
sanctity attached to them by African tribes,&mdash;a sanctity which
continues to this day in many parts of that country, where to kill one
of these reptiles is believed to superinduce dangerous inundations. In
Semitic traditions, also, Leviathan was generally identified as a
demonic crocodile, and the feat of destroying him was calculated to
impress the imaginations of all varieties of people in the Southern
countries for which Christianity struggled so long. This form
contributed some of its characters to the lacertine dragons which were
so often painted in the Middle Ages, with what effect may be gathered
from the accompanying design by Albert Durer (<a href="#v1fig29">Fig.
29</a>). In this loathsome creature, which seeks to prevent deliverance
of &lsquo;the spirits in prison,&rsquo; we may remark the sly and cruel
eye: the pr&aelig;ternatural vision of such monsters was still strong
in the traditions of the sixteenth century. In looking at this
lizard-guard at the mouth of hell we may realise that it has been by
some principle of psychological selection that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb382" href="#v1pb382" name=
"v1pb382">382</a>]</span>the reptilian kingdom gradually gained
supremacy in these portrayals of the repulsive. If we compare with
<a href="#v1fig29">Fig. 29</a> the well-known form of the Chim&aelig;ra
(<a href="#v1fig30">Fig. 30</a>), most of us will be conscious of a
sense of relief; for though the reptilian form is present in the
latter, it is but an appendage&mdash;almost an ornament&mdash;to the
lion. It is impossible to feel any loathing towards this spirited
Trisomatos, and one may recognise in it a different animus from that
which depicted the christian dragon. One was meant to attest the
boldness of the hero who dared to assail it; the other was meant, in
addition to that, to excite hatred and horror of the monster assailed.
We may, therefore, find a very distinct line drawn between such forms
as the Chim&aelig;ra and such as the Hydra, or our conventional Dragon.
The hairy inhabitants of Lycia, human or bestial, whom Bellerophon
conquered,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7489src" href="#xd20e7489" name=
"xd20e7489src">3</a> were not meant to be such an abstract expression
of the evil principle in nature as the Dragon, and while they are
generalised, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb383" href="#v1pb383"
name="v1pb383">383</a>]</span>elements included are also limited. But
the Dragon, with its claws, wings, scales, barbed and coiling tail, its
fiery breath, forked tongue, and frequent horns, includes the organic,
inorganic, the terrestrial and atmospheric, and is the combination of
harmful contrivances in nature.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the Dragon forms, whatever their original types and
their region, are represented in the conventional monster of the
European stage, which meets the popular conception. This Dragon is a
masterpiece of the popular imagination, and it required many
generations to give it artistic shape. Every Christmas he appears in
some London pantomime, with aspect similar to that which he has worn
for many ages. His body is partly green, with memories of the sea and
of slime, and partly brown or dark, with lingering shadow of
storm-clouds. The lightning flames still in his red eyes, and flashes
from his fire-breathing mouth. The thunderbolt of Jove, the spear of
Wodan, are in the barbed point of his tail. His huge
wings&mdash;batlike, spiked&mdash;sum up all the mythical life of
extinct Harpies and Vampyres. Spine of crocodile is on his neck, tail
of the serpent, and all the jagged ridges of rocks and sharp thorns of
jungles bristle around him, while the ice of glaciers and brassy
glitter of sunstrokes are in his scales. He is ideal of all that is
hard, obstructive, perilous, loathsome, horrible in nature: every
detail of him has been seen through and vanquished by man, here or
there, but in selection and combination they rise again as principles,
and conspire to form one great generalisation of the forms of
Pain&mdash;the sum of every creature&rsquo;s worst.</p>

<p class="first">The realm of the Unknown has now, by exploration of
our planet and by science, been pretty well pressed into annexation
with the Unknowable. In early periods, however, unexplored lands and
seas existed only in the human imagination, and men appear to have
included them within the laws of analogy as slowly as their descendants
so included the planets. The monstrous forms with which superstition
now peoples regions of space that cannot be visited could then dwell
securely in parts of the world where their existence or non-existence
could not be verified. Science had not yet shown the simplicity and
unity underlying the superficial varieties of nature; and though Rudolf
Raspe appeared many times, and related the adventures of his Baron
Munchausen in many languages, it was only a hundred years ago that he
managed to raise a laugh over them. It has taken nearly another hundred
to reveal the humour of Munchausenisms that relate to invisible and
future worlds.</p>
<p>The Dragon which now haunts the imagination of a few compulsory
voyagers beyond the grave originated in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb385" href="#v1pb385" name="v1pb385">385</a>]</span>speculations
concerning the unseen shores of equally mythical realms, whose burning
zones and frozen seas had not yet been detached from this planet to
make the Inferno of another. In our section on Demonology we have
considered many of these imaginary forms in detail, limiting ourselves
generally to the more realistic embodiments of special obstacles. Just
above that formation comes the stratum in which we find the separate
features of the previous demonic fauna combining to forms which
indicate the new creative power which, as we have seen, makes nature
over again in its own image.</p>
<p>Beginning thus on the physical plane, with a view of passing to the
social, political, and metaphysical arenas where man has successively
met his Dragons, we may first consider the combination of terrors and
perils, real and imaginary, which were confronted by the early
colonist. I will venture to call this the <span class="sc">Colonial
Dragon</span>.</p>
<p>This form may be represented by any of those forms against which the
Prometheus of &AElig;schylus cautions Io on her way to the realm which
should be called Ionia. &lsquo;When thou shalt have crossed the stream
that bounds the continents to the rosy realms of the morning where the
sun sets forth, ... thou shalt reach beyond the roaring sea
Cisthene&rsquo;s Gorgonian plains, where dwell the Phorkides, ... and
hard by are their three winged sisters, the Snake-haired Gorgons, by
mortals abhorred, on whom none of human race can look and live.... Be
on thy guard against the Gryphons, sharp-fanged hounds of Jove that
never bark, and against the cavalry host of one-eyed Arimaspians,
dwelling on the gold-gushing fount, the stream of Pluto. Thou wilt
reach a distant land, a dark tribe, near to the fount of the sun, where
runs the river &AElig;thiops.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p>One who has looked upon Leonardo da Vinci&rsquo;s Medusa at
Florence&mdash;one of the finest interpretations of a mythologic
subject ever painted&mdash;may comprehend what to the early explorer
and colonist were the fascinations of those rumoured regions where
nature was fair but girt round with terrors. The Gorgon&rsquo;s head
alone is given, with its fearful tangle of serpent tresses; her face,
even in its pain, possesses the beauty that may veil a fatal power;
from her mouth is exhaled a vapour which in its outline has brought
into life vampyre, newt, toad, and loathsome nondescript creatures.
Here is the malaria of undrained coasts, the vermin of noxious nature.
The source of these must be destroyed before man can found his city; it
is the fiery poisonous breath of the Colonial Dragon.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Fig. 31.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bellerophon and
Chim&aelig;ra</span> (Corinthian).</p>
</div>
<p>Most of the Dragon-myths of Great Britain appear to have been
importations of the Colonial monsters. Perhaps the most famous of these
in all Europe was the Chim&aelig;ra, which came westward upon coins,
Bellerophon having become a national hero at Corinth&mdash;almost
superseding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb387" href="#v1pb387"
name="v1pb387">387</a>]</span>the god of war himself&mdash;and his
effigy spread with many migrations. Our conventional figure of St.
George is still Bellerophon, though the Dragon has been substituted for
Chim&aelig;ra,&mdash;a change which christian tradition and national
respect for the lion rendered necessary (<a href="#v1fig31">Fig.
31</a>). Corresponding to this change in outward representation, the
monster-myths of Great Britain have been gradually pressed into service
as moral and religious lessons. The Lambton Worm illustrates the duty
of attending mass and sanctity of the sabbath; the demon serpents of
Ireland and Cornwall prove the potency of holy exorcism; and this
process of moralisation has extended, in the case of the Boar, whose
head graces the Christmas table at Queen&rsquo;s College, Oxford, to an
illustration of the value of Aristotelian philosophy. It was with a
volume of Aristotle that the monster was slain, the mythologic
affinities of the legend being quaintly preserved in the item that it
was thrust down the boar&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>But these modifications are very transparent, the British legends
being mainly variants of one or two original myths which appear to have
grown out of the heraldic devices imported by ancient families. These
probably acquired realistic statement through the prowess and energy of
chieftains, and were exaggerated by their descendants, perhaps also
connected with some benefit to the community, in order to strengthen
the family tenure of its estates. For this kind of duty the Colonial
Dragon was the one usually imported by the family romancer or poet. The
multiplication of these fables is, indeed, sufficiently curious. It
looks as if there were some primitive agrarian sentiment which had to
be encountered by aid of appeals to exceptional warrant. The family
which could trace its title to an estate to an ancestor who rescued the
whole district, was careful to preserve some memorial <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb388" href="#v1pb388" name=
"v1pb388">388</a>]</span>of the feat. On account of the interests
concerned in old times we should be guarded in receiving the
rationalised interpretations of such myths, which have become
traditional in some localities. The barbaric achievements of knights
did not lose in the ballads of minstrels any marvellous splendours, but
gained many; and most of these came from the south and east. The Dragon
which Guy of Warwick slew still retained traces of Chim&aelig;ra; it
had &lsquo;paws as a lion.&rsquo; Sir William Dugdale thought that this
was a romanticised version of a real combat which Guy fought with a
Danish chief, A.C. 926. Similarly the Dragon of Wantley has been
reduced to a fraudulent barrister.</p>
<p>The most characteristic of this class of legends is that of
Sockburn. Soon after the Norman conquest the Conyers family received
that manor by episcopal grant, the tradition being that it was because
Sir John Conyers, Knight, slew a huge Worm which had devoured many
people. The falchion with which this feat was achieved is still
preserved, and I believe it is still the custom, when a new bishop
visits that diocese, for the lord of Sockburn to present this sword.
The lord of the manor meets the bishop in the middle of the river Tees,
and says:&mdash;&lsquo;My Lord Bishop, I here present you with the
falchion wherewith the Champion Conyers slew the Worm, Dragon, or fiery
flying Serpent, which destroyed man, woman, and child, in memory of
which the king then reigning gave him the manor of Sockburn to hold by
this tenure,&mdash;that upon the first entrance of every bishop into
the country this falchion should be presented.&rsquo; The bishop
returns the sword and wishes the lord long enjoyment of the tenure,
which has been thus held since the year 1396. The family tradition is
that the Dragon was a Scotch intruder named Comyn, whom Conyers
compelled to kneel before the episcopal throne. The Conyers family of
Sockburn seem <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb389" href="#v1pb389"
name="v1pb389">389</a>]</span>to have been at last overtaken by a
Dragon which was too much for them: the last knight was taken from a
workhouse barely in time not to die there.</p>
<p>In the &lsquo;Memoirs of the Somervilles&rsquo; we read that one of
that family acquired a parish by slaying a &lsquo;<span lang=

<p class="first">The familiar story of St. Patrick clearing the snakes
out of Ireland, and the Cornish version of it, in which the exorcist is
St. Petrox, presents some features which relate it to the
colonist&rsquo;s combat with his dragon, though it is more interesting
in other aspects. The Colonial Dragon includes the diseases, the wild
beasts, the savages, and all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb390"
href="#v1pb390" name="v1pb390">390</a>]</span>manner of obstructions
which environ a new country. But when these difficulties have been
surmounted, the young settlement has still its foes to contend
with,&mdash;war-like invaders from without, ambitious members within.
We then find the Dragon taking on the form of a public enemy, and his
alleged slayer is representative of the commune,&mdash;possibly in the
end to transmit its more real devourer. Most of the British
Dragon-myths have expanded beyond the stage in which they represent
merely the struggles of immigrants with wild nature, and include the
further stage where they represent the formation of the community. The
growth of patriotism at length is measured by its shadow. The Colonial
is transformed to the Communal Dragon. Many Dragon-myths are
adaptations of the ancient symbolism to <i>hostes communes</i>: such
are the monsters described as desolating villages and districts, until
they are encountered by antagonists animated by public spirit. Such
antagonists are distinguishable from the heroes that go forth to rescue
the maiden in distress: their chief representative in mythology is
Herakles, most of whose labours reveal the man of self-devotion
redressing public wrongs, and raising the standard of humanity as well
as civilisation.</p>
<p>The age of chivalry has its legend in the Centaurs and Cheiron. The
Hippo-centaurs are mounted savages: Cheiron is the true knight,
withstanding monsters in his own shape, saving Peleus from them, and
giving hospitality to the Argonauts. The mounted man was dragon to the
man on foot until he became the chevalier; then the demonic character
passed to the strategist who had no horse. It is curious enough to find
existing among the Mormons a murderous order calling themselves
Danites, or Destroying Angels, after the text of Gen. xlix. 17,
&lsquo;Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb391" href="#v1pb391" name=
"v1pb391">391</a>]</span>path, that biteth the horse&rsquo;s heel that
his rider shall fall backward.&rsquo; The Ritter, however, so far as
his Dragon was concerned, was as one winged, and every horse a Pegasus
when it bore him to decide the day between the adder and its victim. It
is remarkable that the Mormons should have carried from the East a
cruel superstition to find even among the Red Men, who are disappearing
before the western march of Saxon strength, more gentle fables.</p>
<p>Among the Mimacs, the aborigines of Nova Scotia, there is a legend
of a young hero named Keekwajoo, who, in seeking for a wife, is
befriended by a good sage named Glooscap, who warns him against a
powerful magician disguised as a beaver, and two demon sisters, who
will waylay him in the disguise of large weasels. The youth is
admonished to beat a certain drum as his canoe passes them, and he is
saved as Orpheus in passing Cerberus and Ulysses in sailing past the
Syrens. The weasels, hearing the music, aspire to wed the stars, but
find themselves in an indescribable nest at the top of a tall white
pine.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7625src" href="#xd20e7625" name=
"xd20e7625src">3</a></p>
<p>The chevalier encounters also the <span class="sc">Brutal
Dragon</span>, whose victim is Woman. From immemorial time man&rsquo;s
captive, unable to hold her own against brute force, she is at the
mercy of all who are insensible to the refined and passive powers. The
rock-bound Andromeda, the pursued Leto, or whatever fair maid it may be
that the Dragon-slayer rescues, may have begun mythologically as emblem
of the Dawn, whose swallower is the Night Cloud; but in the end she
symbolises a brighter dawn,&mdash;that of civility and magnanimity
among men.</p>
<p>It is a notable fact that far away in Japan we should find a
Dragon-myth which would appear to represent, with rare beauty, the
social evolution we have been considering. Their great mythological
Serpent, <span class="corr" id="xd20e7635" title=

"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb392" href="#v1pb392" name=
"v1pb392">392</a>]</span>that is, the serpent of eight heads and tails,
stretching over eight valleys, would pretty certainly represent a river
annually overflowing its banks. One is reminded by this monster of the
accounts given by Mencius of the difficulties with streams which the
Chinese had to surmount before they could make the Middle States
habitable. But this Colonial Dragon, in the further evolution of the
country, reappears as the <i>Brutal Dragon</i>. The admirable legend
relates that, while the rest of the world were using stone implements,
there came into the possession of Sosano-o-no-Mikoto (the Prince of
Sosano) a piece of iron which was wrought into a sword. That
maiden-sword of the world was fleshed to save a maiden from the jaws of
a monster. The prince descended from heaven to a bank of the river Hino
Kawa, and the country around seemed uninhabited; but presently he saw a
chopped stick floating down the stream, and concluded that there must
be beings dwelling farther up; so he travelled until he came to a spot
where he beheld an aged man and his wife (Asinaduti and Tenaduti), with
their beautiful daughter, Him&eacute; of Inada. The three were weeping
bitterly, and the prince was informed that Him&eacute; was the last of
their daughters, seven of whom had been devoured by a terrible serpent.
This serpent had eight heads, and the condition on which it had ceased
to desolate the district was that one of these eight maidens should be
brought annually to this spot to satisfy his voracity. The last had now
been brought to complete the dreadful compact. The Japanese are careful
to distinguish this serpent from a dragon, with them an agathodemon. It
had no feet, and its heads branched by as many necks from a single
body, this body being so large that it stretched over eight valleys. It
was covered with trees and moss, and its belly was red as blood. The
prince doubted if <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb393" href=
"#v1pb393" name="v1pb393">393</a>]</span>even with his sword he could
encounter such a monster, so he resorted to stratagem; he obtained
eight vast bowls, filled them with eight different kinds of wine, and,
having built a fence with the same number of openings, set a bowl in
each. The result may be imagined: the eight heads in passing over the
bowls paused, drank deep, and were soon in a state of beastly
intoxication. In this condition the heads were severed from their neck,
and the maiden saved to wed the first Mikado Prince. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Theology has pronounced Incarnation a mystery, but
nothing is simpler. The demigod is man&rsquo;s appeal from the gods. It
may also be, as Emerson says, that &lsquo;when the half-gods go the
gods arrive,&rsquo; but it is equally true that their coming signals
the departure of deities which man had long invoked in vain. The great
Heraklean myth presents us the ideal of godlike force united to human
sympathy. Ra (the Sun) passing the twelve gates (Hours) of Hades
(Night)<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7657src" href="#xd20e7657" name=
"xd20e7657src">1</a> is humanised in Herakles and his Twelve Labours.
He is Son of Zeus by a human mother&mdash;Alcmene&mdash;and his labours
for human welfare, as well as his miraculous conception, influenced
Christianity. The divine Man assailing the monsters of divine creation
represents human recognition of the fact that moral order in nature is
co-extensive with the control of mankind. One expression of this
perception is the Alcestis of Euripides, whose significance in relation
to death we have considered.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7660src" href=
"#xd20e7660" name="xd20e7660src">2</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Alcestis,&rsquo; as I have written in another work, &lsquo;is
one of the few ancient Greek melodramas. The majority of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb395" href="#v1pb395" name=
"v1pb395">395</a>]</span>dramas left us by the poets of Greece turn
upon religious themes, and usually they are tragedies. It is evident
that to them the popular religion around them was itself a tragedy.
Their heroes and heroines&mdash;such as Prometheus and
Macaria&mdash;were generally victims of the jealousy or caprice of the
gods; and though the poets display in their dramas the irresistible
power of the gods, they do so without reverence for that power, and
generally show the human victims to be more honourable than the gods.
But the &lsquo;Alcestis&rsquo; of Euripides is not a tragedy; it ends
happily, and in the rescue of one of those victims of the gods. It
stands as about the first notice served on the gods that the human
heart had got tired of their high-handed proceedings, and they might
prepare to quit the thrones of a universe unless they could exhibit
more humanity.... Knowing that neither he nor any other deity can
legally resist the decree of another deity, Apollo is reduced to hope
for help from man. Human justice may save when divine justice
sacrifices. He prophesies to Death that although he may seize Alcestis,
a man will come who will conquer him, and deliver that woman from the
infernal realm.... Then Hercules comes on the scene. He has been
slaying lion and dragon, and he now resolves to conquer Death and
deliver Alcestis. This he does.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7667src" href="#xd20e7667" name="xd20e7667src">3</a></p>
<p>In this pre-christian yet christian Passion Play, the part played by
the heart of woman is equally heroic with that which represents the
honour of man. So in the religion which followed there was an effort to
set beside the incarnate vanquisher of infernal powers the pierced
heart of Mary. But among all the legends of this character it were
difficult to find one more impressive than that which Dr. Leitner found
in Dardistan, and one which, despite its <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb396" href="#v1pb396" name="v1pb396">396</a>]</span>length, will
repay a careful perusal. This legend of the origin of the Ghilghit
tribe and government was told by a native.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once upon a time there lived a race at Ghilghit whose origin
is uncertain. Whether they sprung from the soil or had immigrated from
a distant region is doubtful; so much is believed that they were
Gayup&iacute;, <i>i.e.</i>, spontaneous, aborigines, unknown. Over them
ruled a monarch who was a descendant of the evil spirits, the Yatsh,
who terrorised over the world. His name was Shiribadatt, and he resided
at a castle in front of which was a course for the performance of the
manly game of Polo. His tastes were capricious, and in every one of his
actions his fiendish origin could be discerned. The natives bore his
rule with resignation, for what could they effect against a monarch at
whose command even magic aids were placed? However, the country was
rendered fertile, and round the capital bloomed attractive. The
heavens, or rather the virtuous Peris, at last grew tired of his
tyranny, for he had crowned his iniquities by indulging in a propensity
for cannibalism. This taste had been developed by an accident. One day
his cook brought him some mutton broth the like of which he had never
tasted. After much inquiry as to the nature of the food on which the
sheep had been brought up, it was eventually traced to an old woman,
its first owner. She stated that her child and the sheep were born on
the same day, and losing the former, she had consoled herself by
suckling the latter. This was a revelation to the tyrant. He had
discovered the secret of the palatability of the broth, and was
determined to have a never-ending supply of it. So he ordered that his
kitchen should be regularly provided with children of a tender age,
whose flesh, when converted into broth, would remind him of the
exquisite dish he had once so much relished. This cruel <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb397" href="#v1pb397" name=
"v1pb397">397</a>]</span>order was carried out. The people of the
country were dismayed at such a state of things, and sought slightly to
improve it by sacrificing, in the first place, all orphans and children
of neighbouring tribes. The tyrant, however, was insatiable, and soon
was his cruelty felt by many families at Ghilghit, who were compelled
to give up their children to slaughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Relief came at last. At the top of the mountain Ko, which it
takes a day to ascend, and which overlooks the village of Doyur, below
Ghilghit, on the other side of the river, appeared three figures. They
looked like men, but much more strong and handsome. In their arms they
carried bows and arrows, and turning their eyes in the direction of
Doyur, they perceived innumerable flocks of sheep and cattle grazing on
a prairie between that village and the foot of the mountain. The three
strangers were brothers, and none of them had been born at the same
time. It was their intention to make Azru Shemsher, the youngest, Rajah
of Ghilghit, and, in order to achieve their purpose, they hit upon the
following plan. On the already noticed prairie, which is called
Diding&eacute;, a sportive calf was gambolling towards and away from
its mother. It was the pride of its owner, and its brilliant red colour
could be seen from a distance. &lsquo;Let us see who is the best
marksman,&rsquo; exclaimed the eldest, and, saying this, he shot an
arrow in the direction of the calf, but missed his aim. The second
brother also tried to hit it, but also failed. At last, Azru Shemsher,
who took a deep interest in the sport, shot his arrow, which pierced
the poor animal from side to side and killed it. The brothers, whilst
descending, congratulated Azru on his sportsmanship, and on arriving at
the spot where the calf was lying, proceeded to cut its throat and to
take out from its body <i>the titbits, namely, the kidneys and the
liver</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb398" href="#v1pb398" name=
"v1pb398">398</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;They then roasted these delicacies, and invited Azru to
partake of them first. He respectfully declined, on the ground of his
youth, but they urged him to do so, &lsquo;in order,&rsquo; they said,
&lsquo;to reward you for such an excellent shot.&rsquo; Scarcely had
the meat touched the lips of Azru than the brothers got up, and,
vanishing into the air, called out, &lsquo;Brother! you have touched
impure food, which Peris never should eat, and we have made use of your
ignorance of this law, because we want to make you a human
being<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7689src" href="#xd20e7689" name=
"xd20e7689src">4</a> who shall rule over Ghilghit; remain, therefore,
at Doyur.&rsquo; Azru, in deep grief at the separation, cried,
&lsquo;Why remain at Doyur, unless it be to grind corn?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the brothers, &lsquo;go to Ghilghit.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; was the reply, &lsquo;go to Ghilghit, unless it be
to work in the gardens?&rsquo; &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; was the last and
consoling rejoinder; &lsquo;you will assuredly become the king of this
country, and deliver it from its merciless oppressor!&rsquo; No more
was heard of the departing fairies, and Azru remained by himself,
endeavouring to gather consolation from the great mission which had
been bestowed on him. A villager met him, and, struck by his
appearance, offered him shelter in his house. Next morning he went on
the roof of his host&rsquo;s house, and calling out to him to come up,
pointed to the Ko mountain, on which, he said, he plainly discerned a
wild goat. The incredulous villager began to fear he had harboured a
maniac, if no worse character; but Azru shot off his arrow, and,
accompanied by the villager (who had assembled some friends for
protection, as he was afraid his young guest might be an associate of
robbers, and lead him into a trap), went in the direction of the
mountain. There, to be sure, at the very spot that was pointed out,
though many miles distant, was lying the wild goat, with Azru&rsquo;s
arrow transfixing its body. The astonished peasants at once hailed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb399" href="#v1pb399" name=
"v1pb399">399</a>]</span>him as their leader, but he exacted an oath of
secrecy from them, for he had come to deliver them from their tyrant,
and would keep his incognito till such time as his plans for the
destruction of the monster would be matured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He then took leave of the hospitable people of Doyur, and
went to Ghilghit. On reaching this place, which is scarcely four miles
distant from Doyur, he amused himself by prowling about in the gardens
adjoining the royal residence. There he met one of the female
companions of Shiribadatt&rsquo;s daughter fetching water for the
princess. This lady was remarkably handsome, and of a sweet
disposition. The companion rushed back, and told the young lady to look
from over the ramparts of the castle at a wonderfully handsome young
man whom she had just met. The princess placed herself in a place from
which she could observe any one approaching the fort. Her maid then
returned, and induced Azru to come with her in the Polo ground, in
front of the castle; the princess was smitten with his beauty, and at
once fell in love with him. She then sent word to the young prince to
come and see her. When he was admitted into her presence he for a long
time denied being anything more than a common labourer. At last he
confessed to being a fairy&rsquo;s child, and the overjoyed princess
offered him her heart and hand. It may be mentioned here that the
tyrant Shiribadatt had a wonderful horse, which could cross a mile at
every jump, and which its rider had accustomed to jump both into and
out of the fort, over its walls. So regular were the leaps which this
famous animal could take that he invariably alighted at the distance of
a mile from the fort, and at the same place. On that very day on which
the princess had admitted young Azru into the fort King Shiribadatt was
out hunting, of which he was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb400"
href="#v1pb400" name="v1pb400">400</a>]</span>desperately fond, and to
which he used sometimes to devote a week or two at a time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must now return to Azru, whom we left conversing with the
princess. Azru remained silent when the lady confessed her love. Urged
to declare his sentiments, he said that he would not marry her unless
she bound herself to him by the most stringent oath; this she did, and
they became in the sight of God as if they were wedded man and wife. He
then announced that he had come to destroy her father, and asked her to
kill him herself. This she refused; but as she had sworn to aid him in
every way she could, he finally induced her to promise that she would
ask her father <i>where his soul was</i>. &lsquo;Refuse food,&rsquo;
said Azru, &lsquo;for three or four days, and your father, who is
devotedly fond of you, will ask for the reason of your strange conduct;
then say, &lsquo;Father, you are often staying away from me for several
days at a time, and I am getting distressed lest something should
happen to you; do reassure me by letting me know where your soul is,
and let me feel certain that your life is safe.&rsquo; This the
princess promised to do, and when her father returned refused food for
several days. The anxious Shiribadatt made inquiries, to which she
replied by making the already named request. The tyrant was for a few
moments thrown into mute astonishment, and finally refused compliance
with her preposterous demand. The love-smitten lady went on starving
herself, till at last her father, fearful for his daughter&rsquo;s
life, told her not to fret herself about him as <i>his soul was of
snow, in the snows</i>, and that he could only perish by fire. The
princess communicated this information to her lover. Azru went back to
Doyur and the villages around, and assembled his faithful peasants.
Them he asked to take twigs of the fir-tree, bind them together, and
light them; then to proceed in a body with torches <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb401" href="#v1pb401" name=
"v1pb401">401</a>]</span>to the castle in a circle, keep close
together, and surround it on every side. He then went and dug out a
very deep hole, as deep as a well, in the place where
Shiribadatt&rsquo;s horse used to alight, and covered it with green
boughs. The next day he received information that the torches were
ready. He at once ordered the villagers gradually to draw near the fort
in the manner which he had already indicated.</p>
<p>King Shiribadatt was then sitting in his castle; near him his
treacherous daughter, who was so soon to lose her parent. All at once
he exclaimed, &lsquo;I feel very close; go out, dearest, and see what
has happened.&rsquo; The girl went out, and saw torches approaching
from a distance; but fancying it to be something connected with the
plans of her husband, she went back and said it was nothing. The
torches came nearer and nearer, and the tyrant became exceedingly
restless. &lsquo;Air, air,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;I feel very ill; do
see, daughter, what is the matter.&rsquo; The dutiful lady went, and
returned with the same answer as before. At last the torch-bearers had
fairly surrounded the fort, and Shiribadatt, with a presentiment of
impending danger, rushed out of the room, saying, &lsquo;that he felt
he was dying.&rsquo; He then ran to the stables and mounted his
favourite charger, and with one blow of the whip made him jump over the
wall of the castle. Faithful to its habit the noble animal alighted at
the same place, but, alas! only to find itself engulfed in a
treacherous pit. Before the king had time to extricate himself the
villagers had run up with their torches. &lsquo;Throw them upon
him,&rsquo; cried Azru. With one accord all the blazing wood was thrown
upon Shiribadatt, who miserably perished.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Azru was then most enthusiastically proclaimed king, celebrated his
nuptials with the fair traitor, and, as sole tribute, exacted the
offering of one sheep annually, instead of the human child, from every
one of the natives. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb402" href=
"#v1pb402" name="v1pb402">402</a>]</span></p>
<p>When Azru had safely ascended the throne he ordered the
tyrant&rsquo;s place to be levelled to the ground. The willing
peasants, manufacturing spades of iron, flocked to accomplish a
grateful task, and sang whilst demolishing his castle:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My nature is of a hard metal,&rsquo; said Shiri and Badatt.
&lsquo;Why hard? I, Koto, the son of the peasant Dem Singh, am alone
hardy; with this iron spade I raze to the ground thy kingly house.
Behold now, although thou art of race accursed, of Shatsho Malika, I,
Dem Singh&rsquo;s son, am of a hard metal; for with this iron spade I
level thy very palace; look out! look out!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7718src" href="#xd20e7718" name="xd20e7718src">5</a></p>
<p>An account of the Feast of Torches, instituted as a memorial of this
tradition, has already been given in another connection.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e7723src" href="#xd20e7723" name="xd20e7723src">6</a>
The legend, the festival, and the song just quoted constitute a noble
human epic. That startling defiance of the icy-hearted god by the
human-hearted peasant, that brave cry of the long cowering wretch who
at last holds in his spade an iron weapon to wield against the hardness
of nature, are the sublime p&aelig;an of the Dragon-slayer. Look out,
ye snow-gods! Man&rsquo;s heart is there, and woman&rsquo;s heart;
their courage, plus the spade, can level your palaces; their love will
melt you, their arts and sciences kill you: so fatal may be
torches!</p>
<p>All great religions were born in this grand atheism. As the worship
of Herakles meant the downfall of Zeus, the worship of Christ meant the
overthrow of both Jove and Jehovah. Every race adores the epoch when
their fathers grew ashamed of their gods and identified them as
dragons&mdash;the supreme cruelties of nature&mdash;welcoming the man
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb403" href="#v1pb403" name=
"v1pb403">403</a>]</span>who first rose from his knees and defied them.
But in the end the Priests of the Dragon manage to secure a compromise,
and by labelling him with the name of his slayer, manage to resuscitate
and re-enthrone him. For, as we shall presently see, the Dragon never
really dies.</p>
<p>Christianity did not fail to avail itself of the
Dragon-slayer&rsquo;s prestige, which had preceded it in Europe and in
Africa. It could not afford to offer for popular reverence saints less
heroic than pagan warriors and demigods. The old Dragon-myths,
especially those which made the fame of Herakles, were appropriated to
invest saintly forms. St. Michael, St. Andrew, St. Margaret, and many
another, were pictured subduing or treading on Dragons. Christ was
shown crushing the serpent Sin, spearing the dragon Death, or even
issuing from its impotent jaws, like Jason from the Dragon.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e7732src" href="#xd20e7732" name="xd20e7732src">7</a>
But in this competition for the laurels of dead Dragon-slayers, and
fierce hostility to dragons already slain, the real Dragon was left to
revive and flourish in security, and in the end even inherited the
mantle and the palm of his own former conqueror.</p>
<p>The miscarriage of canonisation in the case of St. George is a small
and merely curious thing in itself; but it is almost mystical in its
coincidence with the great miscarriage which brought the cross of
Christ to authorise the crucifixions of the men most like him for a
thousand years.</p>
<p>Mr. John Ruskin has sharply challenged Ralph Waldo Emerson&rsquo;s
penetrating touch on the effigy that decorates the escutcheons of
England and Russia. &lsquo;George of Cappadocia,&rsquo; says Emerson,
&lsquo;born at Epiphania in Cilicia, was a low parasite, who got a
lucrative contract to supply the army with bacon. A rogue and an
informer, he got rich and was forced to run from justice. He saved his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb404" href="#v1pb404" name=
"v1pb404">404</a>]</span>money, embraced Arianism, collected a library,
and got promoted by a faction to the episcopal throne of Alexandria.
When Julian came, <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 361, George was dragged
to prison. The prison was burst open by the mob, and George was lynched
as he deserved. And this precious knave became in good time Saint
George of England, patron of chivalry, emblem of victory and civility,
and the pride of the best blood of the modern world.&rsquo; Whereon
Emerson further remarks that &lsquo;nature trips us up when we
strut.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is certainly rather hard for the founder of the St. George
Association to be told that his patron was no Dragon-slayer at all, but
the Dragon&rsquo;s ally. Mr. Ruskin may be right in contending that
whatever may have been the facts, they who made George patron saint of
England still meant their homage for a hero, or at any rate not for a
rogue; but he is unsatisfactory in his argument that our St. George was
another who died for his faith seventy years before the
bacon-contractor. Even if the Ruskin St. George, said to have suffered
under Diocletian, could be shown historical, his was a very commonplace
martyrdom compared with that of a bishop torn in pieces by a
&lsquo;pagan&rsquo; mob. The distant christian nations would never have
listened to the pagan version of the story even had it reached them. A
bishop so martyred would have been the very man to give their armies a
watchword. The martyr was portrayed as a Dragon-slayer only as a title
might be added to the name of one knighted, or the badge of an order
set upon his breast; the heraldic device grew into a variant of the
common legend which suggests the origin of the mythical George.
&lsquo;The magician Athanasius, successively an opponent of
Christianity, a convert, and a martyr, is his chief antagonist; and the
city of Alexandria appears as the Empress Alexandria, the wife of
Diocletian, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb405" href="#v1pb405"
name="v1pb405">405</a>]</span>and herself a convert and a
martyr.&rsquo; This sentence from Smith&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dictionary of
Greek and Roman Biography&rsquo; tells more than Professor
Ruskin&rsquo;s seventeenth-century authority. The Dragon is the same
Athanasius whose creed sends forth its anathemas in churches dedicated
to the Arian canonised for having slain him!</p>
<p>Though it be granted that they who made George of Cappadocia the
ideal hero of England really intended their homage for a martyr and
hero, it must equally be acknowledged that his halo was clearly drawn
from Dragon-fire. He was a man who had taken to the sword, and by it
perished; so much was known and announced in his canonisation. He was
honoured as &lsquo;the Victor&rsquo; among the Greeks, therefore to-day
patron of Russia; as protector of Crusaders, therefore now patron of
England; thus is he saint of a war waged by the strong against the
weak, in interest of a church and priesthood against human freedom;
therefore George was taking the side of the Dragon against Christ,
restoring the priestly power he had assailed, and delivering up his
brave brothers in all history to be nailed to Christianity as a
cross.</p>
<p>Let George remain! Whether naming fashionable temples or engraved on
gold coins, the fictitious Dragon-slayer will remain the right saint in
the right place so long as the real Dragon-slayer is made to name every
power he hated, and to consecrate every lie in whose mouth he darted
his spear. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb406" href="#v1pb406" name=

</div>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Asura has already been mentioned as the most ancient
Aryan name for deity. The meaning of it is, the Breather. It has also
been remarked that in the course of time the word came to signify both
the good and the evil spirit. What this evil breath meant in nature is
told in Leonardo da Vinci&rsquo;s picture of the expiring Medusa,
referred to on p. 386, from whose breath noxious creatures are
produced. It may have been that the artist meant only to interpret the
Gorgon as a personification of the malarious vapours of nature and
their organic kindred; if so, he painted better than he knew, and has
suggested that fatal vitality of the evil power which raised it to its
throne as a principle coeternal with good.</p>
<p>The phenomena of recurrence in things evil made for man the mystery
of iniquity. The darkness may be dispersed, but it returns; the storm
may clear away, but it gathers again; inundations, sickly seasons,
dog-days, Cain-winds, they go and return; the cancer is cut out and
grows again; the tyrant may be slain, tyranny survives. The serpent
slipping from one skin to another coils steadily into the symbol of
endlessness. In another expression it <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb407" href="#v1pb407" name="v1pb407">407</a>]</span>is the
poisonous breath of the Dragon. It is this breath that cannot be
killed; the special incarnations of it, any temporary brood of it, may
be destroyed, but the principle in nature which produces them cannot be
exterminated.</p>
<p>Dragon fables have this undertone to their brave strain. In the Rig
Veda (v. 32) it is said that when Indra slew Ahi, &lsquo;another more
powerful was generated.&rsquo; Isaiah (xiv. 29) cries, &lsquo;Rejoice
not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is
broken: for out of the serpent&rsquo;s root shall come forth a
cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.&rsquo;
Herakles struggles with the giant robber, Ant&aelig;us, only to find
the demon&rsquo;s strength restored by contact with the earth. He kills
one head of the Hydra only to see two grow in its place; and even when
he has managed to burn away these, the central head is found to be
immortal, and he can only hide it under a rock. That one is the
self-multiplying principle of evil. The vast brood of Echidna in
mythology expresses the brood of evil in nature. Echidna, daughter of
Ge and Tartarus, Earth and Hell&mdash;phonetic reappearance of
Ahi&mdash;is half-serpent, half-woman, with black eyes, fearful and
bloodthirsty. She becomes the mother of fire-breathing Typhon, buried
beneath the earth by Jove&rsquo;s lightning when he aspired to scale
Olympus; of the Dragon that guarded the Hesperian garden; of the Sphinx
which puzzled and devoured; of three-headed Cerberus; of the eagle that
preyed on rock-bound Prometheus; of the Nem&aelig;an lion which
Herakles slew; of Chim&aelig;ra; and of Scylla the monster whom Homer
describes sitting between two large rocks waylaying mariners on the way
from Italy to Sicily,&mdash;possessing twelve feet, six long necks and
mouths, each with three rows of rushing teeth.</p>
<p>The Dragon that Cadmus slew also had terrible teeth; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb408" href="#v1pb408" name=
"v1pb408">408</a>]</span>and it will be remembered that when these
teeth were sown they sprang up as armed men. Like them, the ancient
Dragon-myths were also sown, broadcast, in the mental and moral fields,
cleared and ploughed by a new theology, and they sprang up as dogmas
more hard and cruel than the ferocious forces of nature which gave
birth to their ancestral monsters.</p>
<p>What the superstitious method of interpreting nature, forced as it
is to personify its painful as well as its pleasant phenomena,
inevitably results in, finds illustration in the two great lines of
tradition&mdash;the Aryan and the Semitic&mdash;which have converged to
form the christian mythology.</p>
<p>The Hebrew personification, Jehovah, originating in a rude period,
became invested with many savage and immoral traditions; but when his
worshippers had reached a higher moral culture, national sentiment had
become too deeply involved with the sovereign majesty of their deity
for his alleged actions to be criticised, or his absolute supremacy and
omnipotence to be questioned, even to save his moral character. Thus,
the Rabbins appear to have been at their wits&rsquo; end to account for
the existence of the two great monsters which had got into their sacred
records&mdash;from an early mythology&mdash;Behemoth and Leviathan.
Unwilling to admit that Jehovah had created foes to his own kingdom, or
that creatures which had become foes to it were beyond his power to
control, they worked out a theory that Behemoth and Leviathan were made
and preserved by special order of Jehovah to execute his decrees at the
Messianic Day of Judgment. They probably corresponded at an earlier
period with the gryphon, or grabber, and the serpent which bit,
guardians at the gate of paradise; but the need of such guards, biters,
and spies by the all-powerful all-seeing <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb409" href="#v1pb409" name="v1pb409">409</a>]</span>Shaddai having
been recognised, the monsters had to be rationalised into accord with
his character as a retributive ruler. Hence Behemoth and Leviathan are
represented as being fattened with the wicked, who die in order to be
the food of the righteous during the unsettled times that follow the
revelation of the Messiah! Behemoth is Jehovah&rsquo;s &lsquo;cattle on
a thousand hills&rsquo; (Ps. i. 10). In Pireque de Rabbi Eliezur he is
described as feeding daily upon a thousand mountains on which the grass
grows again every night; and the Jordan supplies him with drink, as it
is said in Job (xl. 23), &lsquo;he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan
into his mouth.&rsquo; In the Talmud these monsters are divided into
two pairs, but are said to have been made barren lest their progeny
should destroy the earth. They are kept in the wilderness of Dendain,
the mythical abode of the descendants of Cain, east of Eden, for the
unique purpose mentioned.</p>
<p>But now we may remark the steady progress of these monsters to the
bounds of their mythological habitat. There came a time when Behemoth
and Leviathan were hardly more presentable than other personified
horrors. They too must &lsquo;take the veil,&rsquo;&mdash;a period in
the history of mythical, corresponding to extinction in that of actual,
monsters. The following passage in the Book of Enoch is believed by
Professor Drummond to be a later insertion, probably from the Book of
Noah, and as early as the middle of the first century:&mdash;&lsquo;In
that day two monsters shall be divided; a female monster named
Leviathan, to dwell in the abyss of the sea, above the sources of the
waters; but the male is called Behemoth, which occupies with its breast
a desolate wilderness named Dendain, on the east of the garden where
the elect and righteous dwell, where my grandfather (Enoch) was taken
up, being the seventh from Adam, the first man whom the Lord of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb410" href="#v1pb410" name=
"v1pb410">410</a>]</span>the spirits created. And I asked that other
angel to show me the might of these monsters, how they were separated
in one day, and one was set in the depth of the sea, the other on the
firm land of the wilderness. And he spoke to me, &lsquo;Thou son of
man, thou desirest in this to know what has been concealed.&rsquo; And
the other angel who went with me, and showed me what is in concealment,
spake, ... &lsquo;These two monsters are prepared conformably to the
greatness of God to be fed, in order that the penal judgment of God may
not be in vain.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7791src" href=
"#xd20e7791" name="xd20e7791src">1</a></p>
<p>We may thus see that there were antecedents to the sentiment of
Aquinas,&mdash;&lsquo;<span lang="la">Beati in regno c&oelig;lesti
videbunt p&oelig;nas damnatorum, ut beatitudo illis magis
complaceat.</span>&rsquo; Or, perhaps, one might say rather to the
logic of Aquinas; for though he saw that it would be necessary for
souls in bliss to be happy at vision of the damned or else deficient in
bliss, it is said he could hardly be happy from thinking of the
irreversible doom of Satan himself. It would appear that only the
followers of the Genevan who anticipated his god&rsquo;s hell for
Servetus managed to adapt their hearts to such logic, and glory in the
endless tortures of their fellow-creatures.</p>
<p>An eloquent minister in New York, Octavius B. Frothingham, being
requested to write out his views on the &lsquo;question&rsquo; of
everlasting damnation, began with the remark that he felt somewhat as a
sportsman suddenly called upon to hunt the Iguanodon. Really it is
Behemoth and Leviathan he was called to deal with. Leviathan
transmitted from Jonah to the Middle Ages the idea of &lsquo;the belly
of Hell,&rsquo; and Behemoth&rsquo;s jaws expanded in the &lsquo;mouth
of Hell&rsquo; of the Miracle-plays; and their utility, as described in
the Book of Enoch, perhaps originated the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb411" href="#v1pb411" name="v1pb411">411</a>]</span>doctrine of
souls tasting heavenly joys from the agonies of others. The dogma of
Hell has followed the course of its prototype with precision. It has
arrived at just that period when, as in the case of Enoch&rsquo;s
inquiring, the investigator finds it has taken the veil. Theologians
shake their heads, call it a terrible question, write about free-will
and sin, but only a few, of the fatuous sort, confess belief in the
old-fashioned Hell where the worm dieth not and the fire is not
quenched.</p>
<p>Let us now take under consideration the outcome of the Aryan Dragon,
which has travelled far to meet Behemoth in the west. And it is
probable that we could not, with much seeking, find an example so
pregnant with instruction for our present inquiry as our little Durham
folk-tale of the Lambton Worm.</p>
<p>This Worm is said to have been slain by Sir Lambton, crusader, and
ancestor of the Earls of Durham. This young Lambton was a wild fellow;
he was fond of fishing in the river Wear, which runs near Durham
Castle, and he had an especial taste for fishing there on Sunday
mornings. He was profane, and on Sundays, when the people were all
going to mass, they were often shocked by hearing the loud oaths which
Lambton uttered whenever he had no rise. One Sunday morning something
got hold of his hook, pulled strong, and he made sure of a good trout;
what was his disappointment when instead thereof he found at the end of
his line a tiny black worm. He tore it off with fierce imprecations and
threw it in a well near by. However, soon after this the young man
joined the crusaders and went off to the Holy Land, where he
distinguished himself by slaying many Saracens.</p>
<p>But while he was off there things were going on badly around Durham
Castle. Some peasant passing that well into which the youth had cast
the tiny black worm looked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb412" href=
"#v1pb412" name="v1pb412">412</a>]</span>into it, and beheld a creature
that made him shudder,&mdash;a diabolical big snake with nine ferocious
eyes. A little time only had elapsed before this creature had grown too
large for the well to hold it, and it came out and crawled on, making a
path of desolation, breakfasting on a village, until it came to a small
hill. Around that hill it coiled with nine coils, each weighty enough
to make a separate terrace. One may still see this hill with its nine
terraces, and be assured of the circumstances by peasants residing
near. Having taken up its headquarters on this hill, the nine-eyed
monster was in the habit of sallying forth every day and satisfying his
hunger by devouring the plumpest family he could find, until at length
the people consulted an oracle&mdash;some say a witch, others again a
priest&mdash;and were told that the monster would be satisfied if it
were given each day the milk of nine cows. So nine cows were got
together, and a plucky dairymaid was found to milk the cows and carry
it to the dragon. If a single gill of the milk was missing the monster
took a dire revenge upon the nearest village. This was the unpleasant
situation which young Lambton found when he returned home from the
crusades. He was now an altered man. He was no longer given to fishing
and profanity. He felt keenly that by raising the demon out of the
river Wear he had brought woe upon his neighbours, and he resolved to
engage the Worm in single combat. But he learned that it had already
been fought by several knights, and had slain them, while no wounds
received by itself availed anything, since, if it were cut in twain,
the pieces grew together again. The knight then consulted the oracle,
witch or priest, and was told that he could prevail in the combat on
certain conditions. He must provide himself with special armour, all
over which must be large razor-blades. He must manage to entice the
worm into the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb413" href="#v1pb413"
name="v1pb413">413</a>]</span>middle of the river Wear, in whose waters
the combat must take place. And, finally, he must vow to slay as a
sacrifice the first living thing he should meet after his victory.
These conditions having been fulfilled, the knight entered the stream.
The dragon, not having received his milk as usual that morning, crawled
from his hill seeking whom he might devour, and seeing the knight in
the river, went at him. Quickly he coiled around the armour, but its
big razors cut him into many sections; and these sections could not
piece themselves together again because the current of the river washed
them swiftly away.</p>
<p>Now, observe how this dragon was pieced together mythologically. He
is a storm cloud. He begins smaller than a man&rsquo;s hand and swells
to huge dimensions; that characteristic of the howling storm was
represented in the howling wolf Fenris of Norse Mythology, who was a
little pet, a sort of lapdog for the gods at first, but when full grown
broke the chains that tied him to mountains, and was only fettered at
last by the thread finer than cobweb, which was really the sunbeam
conquering winter. Then, when this worm was cut in two, the parts came
together again. This feature of recurrence is especially characteristic
of Hydras. In the Egyptian &lsquo;Tale of Setnau,&rsquo; Ptah-nefer-ka
saw the river-snake twice resume its form after he had killed it with
his sword,&mdash;he succeeded the third time by placing sand between
the two parts; and what returning floods taught the ancient scribe
remained to characterise the dragon encountered by Guy of Warwick,
which recovered from every wound by dipping its tail in the well it had
guarded. The Lernean Hydra had nine heads, the Lambton Worm nine eyes
and nine folds, and drank nine cows&rsquo; milk. His fondness for the
milk of cows connects him straightly with the dragon Vritra, whom Indra
slew because he stole Indra&rsquo;s cows (that is, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb414" href="#v1pb414" name=
"v1pb414">414</a>]</span>the good clouds, whose milk is gentle rain,
and do no harm), and shut them up in a cavern to enjoy their milk
himself. That is the oldest Dragon fable on record, and it is said in
the Rig-Veda that beneath Indra&rsquo;s thunderbolt the monster broke
up into pieces, and was washed away in a current of water. Finally, in
being destroyed at last by razor blades, the dragon is connected with
that slain by Ragnar, in whose armour the sun-darts of Apollo had
turned to icicles. In the &lsquo;Death-Song of Ragnar Lodbrach,&rsquo;
preserved by Olaus Wormius, it is said that King Ella of Northumberland
having captured that terror of the North (8th cent.), ordered him to be
thrown into a pit of serpents. His surname, Lodbrach, or Hair Breeches,
had been given because of his method of slaying a Worm which devastated
Gothland, whose king had promised his daughter to the man who should
slay the same. Ragnar dressed himself in hairy skins, and threw water
over the hair, which, freezing, encased him in an armour of ice. The
Worm, unable to bite through this, was impaled by Ragnar. Another
version is that Ragnar killed two serpents which the King of Gothland
had set to guard his daughter, but which had grown to such size that
they terrified the country. It may be observed that the Lambton story
christianises the Ragnar legend, showing that to be done in atonement
for sin which in the other was done for love. The Cornish legend of St.
Petrox has also taken a hint from Ragnar, and announces the rescue of
christians from the serpent-pit in which the pagan hero perished. The
icicles reappear on the slayer of the dragon of Wantley, represented by
long spikes bristling from his armour.</p>
<p>The Knight Lambton, remembering his vow to slay as a sacrifice the
first living thing he might meet after the combat, had arranged that a
dog should be placed where it would attract his eye. But it turned out
that his own father <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb415" href=
"#v1pb415" name="v1pb415">415</a>]</span>came rushing to him. As he
could not kill his father, he consulted the oracle again to know what
would be the penalty of non-fulfilment of his vow. It was that no
representative of the family should die in his bed for nine
generations. The notion is still found in that neighbourhood that no
Earl of Durham has since then died in his bed. The nine generations
have long passed since any crusading Lambton lived, but several
peasants of the district closed their narrative with, &lsquo;Strange to
say, no Earl of Durham has died in his bed!&rsquo; At the castle I
talked with a servant on the estate while looking at the old statues of
the knight, worm, and dairymaid, all kept there, and he told me he had
heard that the late Earl, as death drew nigh, asked to sit
up&mdash;insisted&mdash;and died in a chair. If there be any truth in
this, it would show that the family itself has some morbid feeling
about the legend which has been so long told them with pride. The old
well from which the little worm emerged a monster is now much
overgrown, but I was told that it was for a long time a wishing-well,
and the pins cast in by rustics may still be seen at the bottom of
it.</p>
<p>Pins are the last offerings at the Worm&rsquo;s Well;
&lsquo;wishes&rsquo; its last prayers; but where go now the coins and
the prayers? To propitiate a power and commute a doom resting upon much
the same principles as those represented in the Lambton legend. A
community desolated because one man is sinful miniatures a
world&rsquo;s doom for Adam&rsquo;s sin. The demand of a human
sacrifice is more clear in the Sockburn story, where Conyers offered up
his only son to the Holy Ghost in the parish church before engaging the
Dragon, that being a condition of success prescribed by the
&lsquo;Oracle&rsquo; or &lsquo;Sybil.&rsquo; This claim of the infernal
powers represented by the Worm&mdash;many-eyed, all-seeing&mdash;cannot
be set aside; Lambton&rsquo;s filial love <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v1pb416" href="#v1pb416" name="v1pb416">416</a>]</span>may resist it
only to have it pass as the hereditary doom of his family, representing
an imputed sin. &lsquo;For I, the Lord thy God, am a jealous God, and
visit the sins of the fathers on the children unto the third and fourth
generation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There are processes of this kind in nature, hereditary evils,
transmitted diseases and disgraces, and afflictions of many through the
offences of one. But a fearful Nemesis follows the deification and
adoration of them. &lsquo;How can I be happy in heaven,&rsquo; said a
tender-hearted lady to her clerical adviser, &lsquo;when I must see
others in hell?&rsquo; &lsquo;You will be made to see that it is all
for the best.&rsquo; &lsquo;If I am to be made so heartless, I prefer
to go to hell.&rsquo; This genuine conversation reports the doom of all
deities whose extension is in dragons. Hell implies a Dragon as its
representative and ruler. Theology may induce the abject and cowardly
to subject their human hearts to the process of induration required for
loyalty to such powers, but in the end it makes atheism the only
salvation of brave, pure, and loving natures. The Dragons&rsquo; breath
has clouded the ancient heavens and blighted the old gods; but the
starry ideals they pursue in vain. Behemoth has supplied sirloins to
many priesthoods for a long time, but he has at last become too tough
even for their teeth, and they feed him less carefully every year. Nay,
he is encountered now and then by his professional feeders, and has
found even in Westminster Abbey his Guy of Warwick.</p>

to cure his warts by providing a weed for them to adhere to. Their end
in Art was in such forms as this starveling creature of Callot&rsquo;s
(<a href="#v1fig32">Fig. 32</a>), whose thin, spectacled rider, tilting
at St. Anthony, denotes as well the doom of all powers, however lofty,
whose majesty requires <i lang="la">tali auxilio et istis
defensoribus</i>. The Dragon passes and leaves a roar of laughter
behind him, in which even St. Anthony could now join. But Leviathan and
Lambton Worm have combined and merged their life in a Dogma; it is a
Dogma as remorseless and voracious as its prototype, and requires to be
fed with all the milk of human kindness, or it at once begins to gnaw
the foundations of Christendom itself. Christianity rests upon the past
work of the Worm in Paradise, and its present work in Hell. It makes no
real difference whether man&rsquo;s belief in a universe enmeshed in
serpent-coils be expressed in the Hindu&rsquo;s cowering adoration of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb418" href="#v1pb418" name=
"v1pb418">418</a>]</span>the venomous potentate, or the
christian&rsquo;s imprecation upon it: fundamentally it is
serpent-worship in each case. Vishnu reposes on his celestial Serpent;
the god of Dogma maintains his government by support of the infernal
Serpent. Fear beheld him appearing in Durham to vindicate the mass and
the Sabbath; but the same fear still sees him in the fiery world
punishing Sabbath-breakers and blasphemers against his Creator and
chief. That fear built every cathedral in Christendom, and they must
crumble with the phantasm evoked for their creation.</p>
<p>The Serpent in itself is a perfect type of all evil in nature. It is
irreconcilable with the reign of a perfectly good and omnipotent man
over the universe. No amount of casuistry can explain its co-existence
with anthropomorphic Love and Wisdom, as all acknowledge when a
parallel casuistry attempts to defend any other god than their own from
deeds that are, humanly considered, evil. It is just as easy to defend
the jealousy and cruelty of Jove, on the ground that his ways are not
as our ways, as it is to defend similar tempers in Jehovah. The monster
sent by one to devour Prometheus is ethically atwin with the snake
created by the other to bite the heel of man.</p>
<p>Man is saved from the superstitious evolution of the venomous
Serpent into a Dragon by recognising its real evolution as seen by the
eye of Science. Science alone can tell the true story of the Serpent,
and justify its place in nature. It forbids man his superstitious
method of making a god in his own image, and his egotistic method of
judging nature according to his private likes and dislikes, his
convenience or inconvenience. Taught by Science man may, with a freedom
the barbarian cannot feel, exterminate the Serpent; with a freedom the
christian cannot know, he may see in that reptile the perfection of
that economy in nature which has ever defended the advancing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb419" href="#v1pb419" name=
"v1pb419">419</a>]</span>forms of life. It judges the good and evil of
every form with reference to its adaptation to its own purposes. Thus
Science alone wields the spear of Ithuriel, and beneath its touch every
Dragon shrinks instantly to its little shape in nature to be dealt with
according to what it is. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb420" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Gustave Dor&egrave; has painted a picture of
&lsquo;Love and Fate,&rsquo; in which the terrible hag is portrayed
towering above the tender Eros, and while the latter is extending the
thread as far as he can, the wrinkled hands of Destiny are the
boundaries of his power, and the fatal shears close upon the joy he has
stretched to its inevitable limit. To the ancient mind these two forms
made the two great realms of the universe, their powers meeting in the
fruit with a worm at its core, in seeds of death germinating amid the
play of life, in all the limitations of man. They are projected in
myths of Elysium and Hades, Eden and the Serpent, Heaven and Hell, and
their manifold variants.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is no one line of mythological development which more
clearly and impressively illustrates the forces under which grew the
idea of an evil principle, than the changes which the personification
of Fate underwent in Greece and Rome. The Moira, or Fate with Homer, is
only a secondary cause, if that, and simply carries out the decrees of
her father, Zeus. Zeus is the real Fate. Nevertheless, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb421" href="#v1pb421" name=
"v1pb421">421</a>]</span>while this is the Homeric theory or theology,
there are intimations (see chap. xxvii. part 4) that the real awe of
men was already transferred from Zeus to the Erinnyes. This foreshadows
a change of government. With Hesiod we find, instead of one, three
Moir&aelig;. They are no longer offspring of Zeus, but, as it were, his
Cabinet. They do not act independently of him, but when, in pursuance
of their just counsels, Zeus issues decrees, the Moir&aelig; administer
them. Next we find the Moir&aelig; of Hesiod developed by other writers
into final Recorders; they write the decrees of Zeus on certain
indestructible tablets, after which they are irrevocable and
inevitable. With &AElig;schylus we find the Moir&aelig; developed into
independent and supreme powers, above Zeus himself. The chained
Prometheus looks not to Zeus but to Fate for his final liberation.</p>

</div>
<p class="first">These great landmarks represent successive revolutions
in the Olympian government. Absolutism became burthensome: as
irresponsible monarch, Zeus became responsible for the woes of the
world, and his priests were satisfied to have an increasing share of
that responsibility allotted to his counsellors, until finally the
whole of it is transferred. From that time the countenance of Zeus, or
Jupiter, shines out unclouded by responsibility for human misfortunes
and earthly evils; and, on the other hand, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb422" href="#v1pb422" name=
"v1pb422">422</a>]</span>once beautiful Fates are proportionately
blackened, and they become hideous hags, the aged and lame crones of
popular belief in Greece and Rome, every line of whose ugliness would
have disfigured the face of Zeus had he not been subordinated to
them.</p>
<p>Moira means &lsquo;share,&rsquo; and originally, perhaps, meant
simply the power that meted out to each his share of life, and of the
pains and pleasures woven in it till the term be reached. But as the
Fates gained more definite personality they began to be regarded as
having also a &lsquo;share&rsquo; of their own. They came to typify all
the dark and formidable powers as to their inevitableness. No divine
power could set them aside, or more than temporarily subdue them. Fate
measured out her share to the remorseless Gorgon as well as to the
fairest god. But where destructive power was exercised in a way
friendly to man, the Fates are put somewhat in the background, and the
feat is claimed for some god. Such, in the &lsquo;Prometheus&rsquo; of
&AElig;schylus, is the spirit of the wonderful passage concerning
Typhon, rendered with tragic depth by Theodore Buckley:&mdash;&lsquo;I
commiserated too,&rsquo; says the rock-bound Prometheus, &lsquo;when I
beheld the earth-born inmate of the Cilician caverns, a tremendous
prodigy, the hundred-headed impetuous Typhon, overpowered by force; who
withstood all the gods, hissing slaughter from his hungry jaws, and
from his eyes there flashed a hideous glare as if he would perforce
overthrow the sovereignty of Jove. But the sleepless shaft of Jupiter
came upon him, the descending thunderbolt breathing forth flame which
scared him out of his presumptuous bravadoes; for having been smitten
to his very soul he was crumbled to a cinder, and thunder-blasted in
his prowess. And now, a hapless and paralysed form, is he lying hard by
a narrow frith, pressed down beneath the roots of &AElig;tna. And,
seated on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb423" href="#v1pb423"
name="v1pb423">423</a>]</span>topmost peaks, Vulcan forges the molten
masses whence there shall burst forth floods, devouring with full jaws
the level fields of fruitful Sicily; with rage such as this shall
Typhon boil over in hot artillery of a never glutted fire-breathing
storm; albeit he hath been reduced to ashes by the thunderbolt of
Jupiter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In this passage we see Jove invested with the glory of defeating a
great demon; but we also recognise the demon still under the protection
of Fate. Destiny must bear that burthen. So was it said in the
Apocalypse Satan should be loosed after being bound in the Pit a
thousand years; and so Mohammed declared Gog and Magog should break
loose with terror and destruction from the mountain-prison in which
Allah had cast them. The destructive Principle had its
&lsquo;share&rsquo; as well as the creative and preservative
Principles, and could not be permanently deprived of it. Gradually the
Fates of various regions and names were identified with the deities,
whose interests, gardens, or treasures they guarded; and when some of
these deities were degraded their retainers were still more degraded,
while in other cases deities were enabled to maintain fair fame by
fables of their being betrayed and their good intentions frustrated by
such subordinates. Thus we find a certain notion of technical and
official power investing such figures as Satan, Ahriman, Iblis, and the
Dragon, as if the upper gods could not disown or reverse altogether the
bad deeds done by these commissioners.</p>
<p>But the large though limited degree of control necessarily claimed
for the greatest and best gods had to be represented theologically.
Hence there was devised a system of Commutation. The Demon or Dragon,
though abusing his power, could not have it violently withdrawn, but
might be compelled to accept some sacrifice in lieu of the precise
object sought by his voracity. These substitutions <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb424" href="#v1pb424" name=
"v1pb424">424</a>]</span>are found in every theological system, and to
apply them to individuals constitutes the <i lang="fr">raison
d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of every priesthood. In the progress towards
civilisation the substitutes diminish in value, and finally they become
merely nominal and ceremonial,&mdash;an effigy of a man instead of the
man, or wine instead of blood. At first the commutation was often in
the substitution of persons of lower for others of higher rank, as when
slaves or wives were, or are, sacrificed to assure paradise to the
master or husband. Thus, Death is allowed to take Alcestis instead of
Admetus. A higher degree of civilisation substitutes animals for human
victims. In keeping with this is the legend of Christ&rsquo;s sending
demons out of two men into a herd of swine:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7930src" href="#xd20e7930" name="xd20e7930src">1</a> which,
again, is referable to the same class of ideas as the legend that
followed concerning Jesus himself as a vicarious offering; mankind in
this case being the herd, as compared with the son of a god, and the
transfer of the Satanic power from the human race to himself, for even
a little time, being accepted in theology as an equivalent, on account
of the divine dignity of the being who descended into hell. It was some
time, however, before theology worked out this theory as it now stands,
the candid fathers having rejoiced in the belief that the contract for
commutation on its face implied that Christ was to remain for ever in
hell, Satan being outwitted in this.</p>
<p>The ancient Babylonian charms often end with the
refrain:&mdash;&lsquo;May the enchantment go forth and to its own
dwelling-place betake itself,&rsquo; Every evil spirit was supposed to
have an appropriate dwelling, as in the case of Judas, into whom Satan
entered,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7937src" href="#xd20e7937" name=
"xd20e7937src">2</a> and of whom it is said he &lsquo;by transgression
fell, that he might go to his own place.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7942src" href="#xd20e7942" name="xd20e7942src">3</a> Very
ingenious are some of the ancient speculations <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v1pb425" href="#v1pb425" name=
"v1pb425">425</a>]</span>concerning the habitations and congenial
resorts of demons. In some regions the colour of a disease on the skin
is supposed to indicate the tastes of the demon causing it; and the
spells of exorcism end by assigning him to something of the same hue.
The demon of jaundice is generally consigned to the yellow parrots, and
inflammation to the red or scarlet weeds. Their colours are respected.
Humanity is little considered in the Eastern formulas of this kind, and
it is pretty generally the case that in praying against plague or
famine, populations are often found selecting a tribe to which their
trouble is adjured to betake itself. &lsquo;May Nin-cigal,&rsquo; says
a Babylonian exorcism, &lsquo;turn her face towards another place; may
the noxious spirit go forth and seize another; may the female cherub
and the female demon settle upon his body; may the king of heaven
preserve, may the king of earth preserve!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So is it in regions and times which we generally think of as
semi-barbarous. But every now and then communities which fancy
themselves civilised and enlightened are brought face to face with the
popular fatalism in its pagan form, and are shocked thereat, not
remembering that it is equally the dogma of vicarious satisfaction or
atonement. A lady residing in the neighbourhood of the Traunsee,
Austria, informs me that recently two men were nearly drowned in that
lake, being rescued at the last moment and brought to life with great
difficulty. But this incident, instead of causing joy among the
neighbours of the men, excited their displeasure; and this not because
the rescued were at all unpopular, but because of a widespread notion
that the Destinies required two lives, that they would have to be
presently satisfied with two others, and that since the agonies of the
drowning men had passed into unconsciousness, it would have been better
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb426" href="#v1pb426" name=
"v1pb426">426</a>]</span>surrender the selected victims to their fate.
At Elsinore, in Denmark, when the sea moans it is said to &lsquo;want
somebody,&rsquo; and it is generally the case that some story of a
person just drowned circulates afterwards.</p>
<p>While the early mythological forms of the Fates diminish and pass
away as curious superstitions, they return in metaphysical disguises.
They gather their kindred in primitive sciences and cosmogonies, and
finding their old home swept free of pagan demons, and, garnished with
philosophic phrases, they enter as grave theories; but their subtlety
and their sting is with them, and the last state of the house they
occupy is worse than the first.</p>
<p>Yes, worse: for all that man ever won of courage or moral freedom,
by conquering his dragons in detail, he surrenders again to the
phantom-forces they typified when he gives up his mind to belief in a
power not himself that makes for evil. The terrible conclusion that
Evil is a positive and imperishable Principle in the universe carries
in it the poisonous breath of every Dragon. It lurks in all theology
which represents the universe as an arena of struggle between good and
evil Principles, and human life as a war of the soul against the flesh.
It animates all the pious horrors which identify Materialism with
wickedness. It nestles in the mind which imagines a personal deity
opposed by any part of nature. It coils around every heart which adores
absolute sovereign Will, however apotheosised.</p>
<p>All of these notions, most of all belief in a supreme arbitrary
Will, are modern disguises of Fate; and belief in Fate is the one thing
fatal to human culture and energy. The notion of Fate (<i>fatum</i>,
the word spoken) carries in it the conception of arbitrariness in the
universe, of power deliberately exerted without necessary reference to
the nature of things; and it is precisely opposed to that idea
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb427" href="#v1pb427" name=
"v1pb427">427</a>]</span>of Necessity taught by Science, which is
another name for the supremacy of Law. Happily the notion of a universe
held at the mercy of a personal decree is suicidal in a world full of
sorrows and agonies, which, on such a theory, can only be traced to
some individual caprice or malevolence. However long abject fear may
silence the lips of the suffering, rebellion is in their hearts. Every
blow inflicted, directly or permissively, by mere Will, however
omnipotent, every agony that is consciously detached from universal
organic necessity, in order that it may be called
&lsquo;providential,&rsquo; can arouse no natural feeling in man nobler
than indignation. The feeling of a suitor in a court of law, who knows
that the adverse judgment that ruins him has no root in the facts or
the law, but proceeds from the prejudice or whim of the judge, can be
nowise different from that of a mother who sees her son stricken down
by death, and hears at his grave that he was consumed by the wrath of a
god who might have yielded to her prayer, but refused it. The
heart&rsquo;s protest may be throttled for a time by the lingering coil
of terror, but it is there, and christian theologians will be as
anxious to protect their deity from it, at whatever cost to his
sovereignty, as their predecessors who invented the Cabinet of Women to
relieve Jove from responsibility.</p>
<p>Metaphysics&mdash;which appear to have developed into the art of
making things look true in words when their untruth in fact has been
detected&mdash;have indeed already set about the task just predicted.
Eminent divines are found writing about matter and spirit, freedom and
natural law, as solemnly as if all this discussion were new, and had
never been carried out to its inevitable results. They can only put in
christian or modern phraseology conclusions which have been reached
again and again in the history of human speculation. The various
schools <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v1pb428" href="#v1pb428" name=
"v1pb428">428</a>]</span>of Buddhist and Vedantist philosophy have come
by every conceivable route to their fundamental unity of belief in God,
Soul, and Matter; in a pessimist visible nature, an ideal invisible
nature, and a human soul held in matter like a frog in a snake&rsquo;s
mouth, but able by certain mysterious, mostly metaphysical or verbal,
tactics, to gain release, and pass into a corresponding situation in
the deity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As a king, whose son had strayed away from him and lived in
ignorance of his father among the Veddahs (wild men), will, on
discovering his son, exclaim, &lsquo;Come to me, my darling son!&rsquo;
and make him a participator of the happiness he himself enjoys, even so
will the Supreme God present himself before the soul when in
distress&mdash;the soul enmeshed in the net of the five Veddahs
(senses), and, severing that soul from P&acirc;sam (Matter), assimilate
it to himself, and bless it at his holy feet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is too late for man to be interested in an
&lsquo;omnipotent&rsquo; Personality, whose power is mysteriously
limited at the precise point when it is needed, and whose moral
government is another name for man&rsquo;s own control of nature.
Nevertheless, this Oriental pessimism is the Pauline theory of Matter,
and it is the speculative protoplasm out of which has been evolved, in
many shapes, that personification which remains for our
consideration&mdash;the Devil.</p>

<p class="first">&lsquo;We are all nothing other than Wills,&rsquo;
says St. Augustine; and he adds that of the good and bad angels the
nature is the same, the will different. In harmony with this John
Beaumont says, &lsquo;A good desire of mind is a good God.<span class=
"corr" id="xd20e7990" title="Source: &rdquo;">&rsquo;</span><a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e7992src" href="#xd20e7992" name="xd20e7992src">1</a>
To which all the mythology of Evil adds, a bad desire of mind is a
Devil. Every personification of an evil Will looks beyond the outward
phenomena of pain, and conceives a heart that loves evil, a spirit that
makes for wickedness. At this point a new element altogether enters.
The physical pain incidentally represented by the Demon, generalised
and organised into a principle of harmfulness in the Dragon, begins now
to pass under the shadow cast by the ascending light of man&rsquo;s
moral nature. Man becomes conscious of moral and spiritual pains: they
may be still imaginatively connected with bodily <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb2" href="#v2pb2" name=
"v2pb2">2</a>]</span>agonies, but these drop out of the immediate
conception, disappear into a distant future, and are even replaced by
the notion of an evil symbolised by pleasure.</p>
<p>The fundamental difference between either a Demon or Dragon and a
Devil may be recognised in this: we never find the former voluntarily
bestowing physical pleasure or happiness on man, whereas it is a chief
part of the notion of a Devil that he often confers earthly favours in
order to corrupt the moral nature.</p>
<p>There are, indeed, apparent exceptions to this theorem presented in
the agatho-dragons which have already been considered in our chapter on
the Basilisk; but the reader will observe that there is no intimation
in such myths of any malign ulterior purpose in the good omens brought
by those exceptional monsters, and that they are really forms of
malevolent power whose afflictive intent is supposed to have been
vanquished by the superior might of the heroes or saints to whose glory
they are reluctantly compelled to become tributary.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the Dragon attended this moral and religious development
of man&rsquo;s inward nature very far, and still occupies, as at once
prisoner and gaoler in the underworld, a subordinate relation to it. In
the long process he has undergone certain transformations, and in
particular his attribute of wings, if not derived from the notion of
his struggle against holier beings, seems to have been largely enhanced
thereby. The exceptional wings given to serpents in Greek art, those,
for instance, which draw Demeter and Persephone in their chariot, are
trifling as compared with the fully-developed wings of our conventional
Dragon of the christian era. Such wings might have been developed
occasionally to denote the flying cloud, the fire-breathing storm, or
explain how some R&aacute;hu was enabled to pursue the sun and moon and
swallow them temporarily <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb3" href=
"#v2pb3" name="v2pb3">3</a>]</span>in the phenomena of eclipse. But
these wings grew to more important dimensions when they were caught up
into the Semitic conception of winged genii and destroying angels, and
associated with an ambitious assault on heaven and its divine or
angelic occupants.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was war in Heaven,&rsquo; says the Apocalypse. The
traditional descriptions of this war follow pretty closely, in dramatic
details, other and more ancient struggles which reflect man&rsquo;s
encounters with the hardships of nature. In those encounters man
imagined the gods descending earthward to mingle in the fray; but even
where the struggle mounted highest the scenery is mainly terrestrial
and the issues those of place and power, the dominion of visible Light
established above Darkness, or of a comparatively civilised over a
savage race. The wars between the Devas and Asuras in India, the Devs
and Ahuras in Persia, Buddha and the Nagas in Ceylon, Gar&uacute;ra and
the Serpent-men in the north of India, gods and Frost-giants in
Scandinavia, still concern man&rsquo;s relation to the fruits of the
earth, to heat and frost, to darkness or storm and sunshine.</p>
<p>But some of these at length find versions which reveal their
tendency towards spiritualisation. The differences presented by one of
these legends which has survived among us in nearly its ancient form
from the same which remains in a partly mystical form will illustrate
the transitional phase. Thus, Gar&uacute;ra expelling the serpents from
his realm in India is not a saintly legend; this exterminator of
serpents is said to have compelled the reptile race to send him one of
their number daily that he might eat it, and the rationalised tradition
interprets this as the prince&rsquo;s cannibalism. The expulsion of
Nagas or serpents from Ceylon by Buddha, in order that he might
consecrate that island to the holy law, marks the pious accentuation
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb4" href="#v2pb4" name=
"v2pb4">4</a>]</span>of the fable. The expulsion of snakes from Ireland
by St. Patrick is a legend conceived in the spirit of the curse
pronounced upon the serpent in Eden, but in this case the modern myth
is the more primitive morally, and more nearly represents the exploit
of Gar&uacute;ra. St. Patrick expels the snakes that he may make
Ireland a paradise physically, and establish his reputation as an

and in this particular it slightly rises above the Hindu story. In the
case of the serpent cursed in Eden a further moralisation of the
conflict is shown. The serpent is not present in Eden, as in the realms
of Gar&uacute;ra and St. Patrick, for purposes of physical devastation
or pain, but to bestow a pleasure on man with a view to success in a
further issue between himself and the deity. Yet in this Eden myth the
ancient combat is not yet fairly spiritualised; for the issue still
relates, as in that between the Devas and Asuras, to the possession of
a magical fruit which by no means confers sanctity. In the apocalyptic
legend of the war in heaven,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e8016src" href=
"#xd20e8016" name="xd20e8016src">3</a> the legend has become fairly
spiritualised. The issue is no longer terrestrial, it is no longer for
mere power; the Dragon is arrayed against the woman and child, and
against the spiritual &lsquo;salvation&rsquo; of mankind, of whom he is
&lsquo;accuser&rsquo; and &lsquo;deceiver.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Surely nobody could be &lsquo;deceived&rsquo; by &lsquo;a great
fiery-red Dragon, having seven heads and ten horns&rsquo;! In this
vision the Dragon is pressed as far as the form can go in the
symbolisation of evil. To devour the child is its legitimate work, but
as &lsquo;accuser of the brethren before God day and night&rsquo; the
monstrous shape were surely out of place by any mythologic analogy; and
one could hardly imagine such a physiognomy capable of deceiving
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb5" href="#v2pb5" name=
"v2pb5">5</a>]</span>&lsquo;the whole world.&rsquo; It is not
wonderful, therefore, that the Dragon&rsquo;s presence in heaven is
only mentioned in connection with his fall from it. It is significant
that the wings are lost in this fall; for while his
&lsquo;angelic&rsquo; relationship suggests the previous wings, the
woman is able to escape the fallen monster by the two wings given
her.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e8025src" href="#xd20e8025" name=
"xd20e8025src">4</a> Wingless now, &lsquo;the old serpent&rsquo; once
more, the monster&rsquo;s shape has no adaptation to the moral and
religious struggle which is to ensue. For his shape is a method, and it
means the perfection of brute force. That, indeed, also remains in the
sequel of this magnificent myth. As in the legend of the Hydra two
heads spring up in place of that which falls, so in this Christian
legend out of the overthrown monster, henceforth himself concealed, two
arise from his inspiration,&mdash;the seven-headed, ten-horned Beast
who continues the work of wrath and pain; but also a lamb-like Beast,
with only two horns (far less terrible), and able to deceive by his
miracles, for he is even able to call down fire from heaven. The
ancient Serpent-dragon, the expression of natural pain, thus goes to
pieces. His older part remains to work mischief and hurt; and the cry
is uttered, &lsquo;Be merry, ye heavens, and ye that tabernacle in
them: woe to the earth and the sea! for the devil is come down unto
you, having great wrath because he knows that he has a short
time.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e8030src" href="#xd20e8030"
name="xd20e8030src">5</a> But there is a lamb-like part of him too, and
his relation to the Dragon is only known by his voice.</p>
<p>This subtle adaptation of the symbol of external pain to the
representation of the moral struggle, wherein the hostile power may
assume deceptive forms of beauty and pleasure, is only one impressive
illustration of the transfer of human conceptions of evil from outward
to inward <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb6" href="#v2pb6" name=
"v2pb6">6</a>]</span>nature. The transition is from a malevolent,
fatal, principle of harmfulness to the body to a malevolent, fatal,
principle of evil to the conscience. The Demon was natural; the Dragon
was both physical and metaphysical; the Devil was and is theological.
In the primitive Zoroastrian theology, where the Devil first appears in
clear definition, he is the opponent of the Good Mind, and the combat
between the two, Ormuzd and Ahriman, is the spiritualisation of the
combat between Light and Darkness, Pain and Happiness, in the external
world. As these visible antagonists were supposed to be exactly
balanced against each other, so are their spiritual correlatives. The
Two Minds are described as Twins.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Those old Spirits, who are twins, made known what is good and
what is evil in thoughts, words, and deeds. Those who are good
distinguished between the two; not so those who are evil-doers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When these two Spirits came together they made first life and
death, so that there should be at last the most wretched life for the
bad, but for the good blessedness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of these two Spirits the evil one chose the worst deeds; the
kind Spirit, he whose garment is the immovable sky, chose what is
right.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e8046src" href="#xd20e8046"
name="xd20e8046src">6</a></p>
<p>This metaphysical theory follows closely the primitive scientific
observations on which it is based; it is the cold of the cold, the
gloom of the darkness, the sting of death, translated into some order
for the intellect which, having passed through the Dragon, we find
appearing in this Persian Devil; and against his blackness the glory of
the personality from whom all good things proceed shines out in a
splendour no longer marred by association with the evil side of nature.
Ormuzd is celebrated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb7" href="#v2pb7"
name="v2pb7">7</a>]</span>as &lsquo;father of the <i>pure</i>
world,&rsquo; who sustains &lsquo;the earth and the clouds that they do
not fall,&rsquo; and &lsquo;has made the <i>kindly</i> light and the
darkness, the kindly sleep and the awaking;&rsquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e8059src" href="#xd20e8059" name="xd20e8059src">7</a> at every
step being suggested the father of the <i>impure</i> world, the
<i>unkindly</i> light, darkness or sleep.</p>
<p>The ecstasy which attended man&rsquo;s first vision of an ideal life
defied the contradictory facts of outward and inward nature. So soon as
he had beheld a purer image of himself rising above his own animalism,
he must not only regard that animalism as an instigation of a devil,
but also the like of it in nature; and this conception will proceed
<i lang="la">pari passu</i> with the creation of pure deities in the
image of that higher self. There was as yet no philosophy demanding
unity in the Cosmos, or forbidding man to hold as accursed so much of
nature as did not obviously accord with his ideals.</p>
<p>Mr. Edward B. Tylor has traced the growth of Animism from
man&rsquo;s shadow and his breathing; Sir John Lubbock has traced the
influence of dreams in forming around him a ghostly world; Mr. Herbert
Spencer has given an analysis of the probable processes by which this
invisible environment was shaped for the mental conception in
accordance with family and social conditions. But it is necessary that
we should here recognise the shadow that walked by the moral nature,
the breathings of religious aspiration, and the dreams which visited a
man whose moral sense was so generally at variance with his animal
desires. The code established for the common good, while necessarily
having a relation to every individual conscience, is a restriction upon
individual liberty. The conflict between selfishness and duty is thus
inaugurated; it continues in the struggle between the &lsquo;law in the
members <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb8" href="#v2pb8" name=
"v2pb8">8</a>]</span>and the law in the spirit,&rsquo; which led Paul
to beat his body (<span class="trans" title="hypopiaxomai"><span class=
"Greek" lang=
"el">&#8017;&pi;&omicron;&pi;&iota;&alpha;&xi;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&#8055;</span></span>)
to keep it in subjection; it passes from the Latin poet to the
Englishman, who turns his experience to a rune&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">I see the right, and I approve it too;</p>
<p class="line">Condemn the wrong, and yet the wrong pursue.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">As the light which cast it was intense, even so
intense was the shadow it cast beneath all it could not penetrate.
Passionate as was the saintliest man&rsquo;s love of good, even so
passionate was his spiritual enemy&rsquo;s love of evil. High as was
the azure vault that mingled with his dreams of purity, so deep was the
abyss beneath his lower nature. The superficial equalities of
phenomena, painful and pleasurable, to his animal nature had cast the
mould into which his theories of the inward and the moral phenomena
must be cast; and thus man&mdash;in an august moment&mdash;surrendered
himself to the dreadful conception of a supreme Principle of
Wickedness: wherever good was there stood its adversary; wherever
truth, there its denier; no light shone without the dark presence that
would quench it; innocence had its official accuser, virtue its
accomplished tempter, peace its breaker, faith its disturber and
mocker. Nay, to this impersonation was added the last feature of
fiendishness, a nature which found its supreme satisfaction in
ultimately torturing human beings for the sins instigated by
himself.</p>
<p>It is open to question how far any average of mankind really
conceived this theological dogma. Easy as it is to put into clear
verbal statement; readily as the analogies of nature supply arguments
for and illustrations of a balance between moral light and darkness,
love and hatred; yet is man limited in subjective conceptions to his
own possibilities, and it may almost be said that to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb9" href="#v2pb9" name=
"v2pb9">9</a>]</span>genuinely believe in an absolute Fiend a man would
have to be potentially one himself. But any human being, animated by
causeless and purposeless desire to inflict pain on others, would be
universally regarded as insane, much more one who would without motive
corrupt as well as afflict.</p>
<p>Even theological statements of the personality of Evil, and what
that implies, are rare. The following is brave enough to be put on
record, apart from its suggestiveness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It cannot be denied that as there is an inspiration of holy
love, so is there an inspiration of hatred, or frantic pleasure, with
which men surrender themselves to the impulses of destructiveness; and
when the popular language speaks of possessions of Satan, of incarnate
devils, there lies at the bottom of this the grave truth that men, by
continued sinning, may pass the ordinary limit between human and
diabolic depravity, and lay open in themselves a deep abyss of hatred
which, without any mixture of self-interest, finds its gratification in
devastation and woe.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e8101src" href=
"#xd20e8101" name="xd20e8101src">8</a></p>
<p>On this it may be said that the popular commentary on cases of the
kind is contained in the very phrase alluded to,
&lsquo;possession,&rsquo;&mdash;the implication being that such
disinterested depravity is nowise possible within the range of simple
human experience,&mdash;and, in modern times, &lsquo;possessions&rsquo;
are treated in asylums. Morbid conditions, however, are of such varied
degrees that it is probable many have imagined a Being in whom their
worst impulses are unrestrained, and thus there have been sufficient
popular approximations to an imaginative conception of a Devil to
enable the theological dogma, which few can analyse, to survive.</p>
<p>It must not be supposed, however, that the moral and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb10" href="#v2pb10" name=
"v2pb10">10</a>]</span>spiritual ideals, to which allusion has just
been made, are normally represented in the various Devils which we have
to consider. It is the characteristic of personifications, whether
celestial or infernal, to supersede gradually the ideas out of which
they spring. As in the fable of Agni, who is said to have devoured his
parents when he was born, a metaphor of fire consuming the two sticks
which produce it, religious history shows both deities and devils, by
the flame of personal devotion or hatred they engender, burning up the
ideas that originate them. When instead of unconscious forces and
inanimate laws working to results called good and evil, men see great
personal Wills engaged in personal conflict, the universe becomes a
government of combat; the stars of heaven, the angels and the imps, men
and women, the very plants and animals, are caught up in the battle, to
be marshalled on one side or the other; and in the military spirit and
fury of the struggle the spiritual ideals become as insignificant
beneath the phantom-hosts they evoked as the violets and daisies which
an army tramples in its march. There is little difference at last
between the moral characteristics of the respective armies of Ormuzd
and Ahriman, Michael and Satan; their strategy and ferocity are the
same.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e8114src" href="#xd20e8114" name=
"xd20e8114src">9</a> Wherever the conception is that of a universe
divided into hostile camps, the appropriate passions are kindled, and
in the thick of the field, where Cruelty and Gentleness met, is seen at
last a horned Beast confronted by a horned Lamb.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e8117src" href="#xd20e8117" name="xd20e8117src">10</a> On both
sides is exaltation of the horn. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb11"
href="#v2pb11" name="v2pb11">11</a>]</span></p>
<p>We need only look at the outcome of the gentle and lowly Jesus
through the exigencies of the church militant to see how potent are
such forces. Although lay Christians of ordinary education are
accustomed to rationalise their dogmas as well as they can, and dwell
on the loving and patient characteristics of Jesus, the horns which
were attached to the brow of him who said, &lsquo;Love your
enemies&rsquo; by ages of Christian warfare remain still in the Christ
of Theology, and they are still depended on to overawe the
&lsquo;sinner.&rsquo; In an orthodox family with which I have had some
acquaintance, a little boy, who had used naughty expressions of
resentment towards a playmate was admonished that he should be more
like Christ, &lsquo;who never did any harm to his enemies.&rsquo;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; answered the wrathful child, &lsquo;but he&rsquo;s
a-going to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As in Demonology we trace the struggles of man with external
obstructions, and the phantasms in which these were reflected until
they were understood or surmounted, we have now to consider the forms
which report human progression on a higher plane,&mdash;that of social,
moral, and religious evolution. Creations of a crude Theology, in its
attempt to interpret the moral sentiment, the Devils to which we now
turn our attention have multiplied as the various interests of mankind
have come into relations with their conscience. Every degree of ascent
of the moral nature has been marked by innumerable new shadows cast
athwart the mind and the life of man. Every new heaven of ideas is
followed by a new earth, but ere this conformity of things to thoughts
can take place struggles must come and the old demons will be recalled
for new service. As time goes on things new grow old; the fresh issues
pass away, their battlefields grow cold; then the brood of superstition
must flit away to the next field where carrion <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb12" href="#v2pb12" name="v2pb12">12</a>]</span>is
found. Foul and repulsive as are these vultures of the
mind&mdash;organisms of moral sewage&mdash;every one of them is a
witness to the victories of mankind over the evils they shadow, and to
the steady advance of a new earth which supplies them no habitat but
the arch&aelig;ologist&rsquo;s page. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

</div>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A lady residing in Hampshire, England, recently said
to a friend of the present writer, both being mothers, &lsquo;Do you
make your children bow their heads whenever they mention the
Devil&rsquo;s name? I do,&rsquo; she added solemnly,&mdash;&lsquo;I
think it&rsquo;s safer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This instance of reverence for the Devil&rsquo;s name, occurring in
a respectable English family, may excite a smile; but if my reader has
perused the third and fourth chapters (Part I.) of this work, in which
it was necessary to state certain facts and principles which underlie
the phenomena of degradation in both Demonology and Devil-lore, he will
already know the high significance of nearly all the names which have
invested the personifications of evil; and he will not be surprised to
find their original sanctity, though lowered, sometimes, surviving in
such imaginary forms after the battles in which they were vanquished
have passed out of all contemporary interest. If, for example, instead
of the Devil, whose name is uttered with respect in the Hampshire
household, any theological bogey of our own time were there mentioned,
such as &lsquo;Atheist,&rsquo; it might hardly receive such considerate
treatment.</p>
<p>The two chapters just referred to anticipate much that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb14" href="#v2pb14" name=
"v2pb14">14</a>]</span>should be considered at this point of our
inquiry. It is only necessary here to supplement them with a brief
statement, and to some extent a recapitulation, of the processes by
which degraded deities are preserved to continue through a structural
development and fulfil a necessary part in every theological scheme
which includes the conception of an eternal difference between good and
evil.</p>
<p>Every personification when it first appears expresses a higher and
larger view. When deities representing the physical needs of mankind
have failed, as they necessarily must, to meet those needs, atheism
follows, though it cannot for a long time find philosophical
expression. It is an atheism <i>ad hoc</i>, so to say, and works by
degrading particular gods instead of by constructing antitheistic
theories. Successive dynasties of deities arise and flourish in this
way, each representing a less arbitrary relation to nature,&mdash;peril
lying in that direction,&mdash;and a higher moral and spiritual ideal,
this being the stronghold of deities. It is obvious that it is far
easier to maintain the theory that prayers are heard and answered by a
deity if those prayers are limited to spiritual requests, than when
they are petitions for outward benefits. By giving over the cruel and
remorseless forces of nature to the Devil,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, to this
or that personification of them who, as gods, had been appealed to in
vain to soften such forces,&mdash;the more spiritual god that follows
gains in security as well as beauty what he surrenders of empire and
omnipotence. This law, illustrated in our chapter on Fate, operates
with tremendous effect upon the conditions under which the old combat
is spiritualised.</p>
<p>An eloquent preacher has said:&mdash;&lsquo;Hawthorne&rsquo;s fine
fancy of the youth who ascribed heroic qualities to the stone face on
the brow of a cliff, thus converting the rocky profile into a man, and,
by dint of meditating on it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb15" href=
"#v2pb15" name="v2pb15">15</a>]</span>with admiring awe, actually
transferred to himself the moral elements he worshipped, has been made
fact a thousand times, is made fact every day, by earnest spirits who
by faithful longing turn their visions into verities, and obtain live
answers to their petitions to shadows.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e8163src" href="#xd20e8163" name="xd20e8163src">1</a></p>
<p>However imaginary may be the benedictions so derived by the
worshipper from his image, they are most real as they redound to the
glory and power of the image. The crudest personification, gathering up
the sanctities of generations, associated with the holiest hopes, the
best emotions, the profoundest aspirations of human nature, may be at
length so identified with these sentiments that they all seem
absolutely dependent upon the image they invest. Every criticism of
such a personification then seems like a blow aimed at the moral laws.
If educated men are still found in Christendom discussing whether
morality can survive the overthrow of such personifications, and
whether life were worth living without them, we may readily understand
how in times when the social, ethical, and psychological sciences did
not exist at all, all that human beings valued seemed destined to stand
or fall with the Person supposed to be their only keystone.</p>
<p>But no Personage, however highly throned, can arrest the sun and
moon, or the mind and life of humanity. With every advance in physical
or social conditions moral elements must be influenced; every new
combination involves a recast of experiences, and presently of
convictions. Henceforth the deified image can only remain as a tyrant
over the heart and brain which have created it,&mdash;</p>
<div lang="it" class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd20e2720">Creatura a un tempo</p>
<p class="line">E tiranno de l&rsquo;uom, da cui soltanto</p>
<p class="line">Ebbe nomi ed aspetti e regno e altari.<a class=

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb16" href="#v2pb16" name=
"v2pb16">16</a>]</span></p>
<p>This personification, thus &lsquo;at once man&rsquo;s creature and
his tyrant,&rsquo; is objectively a name. But as it has been invested
with all that has been most sacred, it is inevitable that any name
raised against it shall be equally associated with all that has been
considered basest. This also must be personified, for the same reason
that the good is personified; and as names are chiefly hereditary, it
pretty generally happens that the title of some fallen and discredited
deity is advanced to receive the new anathema. But what else does he
receive? The new ideas; the growing ideals and the fresh enthusiasms
are associated with some fantastic shape with anathematised name evoked
from the past, and thus a portentous situation is reached. The
worshippers of the new image will not accept the bad name and its base
associations; they even grow strong enough to claim the name and altars
of the existing order, and give battle for the same. Then occurs the
demoralisation, literally speaking, of the older theology. The
personification reduced to struggle for its existence can no longer lay
emphasis upon the moral principles it had embodied, these being equally
possessed by their opponents; nay, its partisans manage to associate
with their holy Name so much bigotry and cruelty that the innovators
are at length willing to resign it. The personal loyalty, which is
found to continue after loyalty to principles has ceased, proceeds to
degrade the virtues once reverenced when they are found connected with
a rival name. &lsquo;He casteth out devils through Beelzebub&rsquo; is
a very ancient cry. It was heard again when Tertullian said,
&lsquo;Satan is God&rsquo;s ape.&rsquo; St. Augustine recognises the
similarity between the observances of Christians and pagans as proving
the subtle imitativeness of the Devil; the phenomena referred to are
considered elsewhere, but, in the present connection, it may be
remarked that this readiness <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb17"
href="#v2pb17" name="v2pb17">17</a>]</span>to regard the same sacrament
as supremely holy or supremely diabolical as it is celebrated in honour
of one name or another, accords closely with the reverence or
detestation of things more important than sacraments, as they are, or
are not, consecrated by what each theology deems official sanction.
When sects talk of &lsquo;mere morality&rsquo; we may recognise in the
phrase the last faint war-cry of a god from whom the spiritual ideal
has passed away, and whose name even can survive only through alliance
with the new claimant of his altars. While the new gods were being
called devils the old ones were becoming such.</p>
<p>The victory of the new ideal turns the old one to an idol. But we
are considering a phase of the world when superstition must invest the
new as well as the old, though in a weaker degree. A new religious
system prevails chiefly through its moral superiority to that it
supersedes; but when it has succeeded to the temples and altars
consecrated to previous divinities, when the ardour of battle is over
and conciliation becomes a policy as well as a virtue, the old idol is
likely to be treated with respect, and may not impossibly be brought
into friendly relation with its victorious adversary. He may take his
place as &lsquo;the second best,&rsquo; to borrow Goethe&rsquo;s
phrase, and be assigned some function in the new theologic
r&eacute;gime. Thus, behind the simplicity of the Hampshire lady
instructing her children to bow at mention of the Devil&rsquo;s name,
stretch the centuries in which Christian divines have as warmly
defended the existence of Satan as that of God himself. With sufficient
reason: that infernal being, some time God&rsquo;s &lsquo;ape&rsquo;
and rival, was necessarily developed into his present position and
office of agent and executioner under the divine government. He is the
great Second Best; and it is a strange hallucination to fancy that, in
an age of peaceful inquiry, any divine personification can be
maintained <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb18" href="#v2pb18" name=
"v2pb18">18</a>]</span>without this patient Goat, who bears blame for
all the faults of nature, and who relieves divine Love from the odium
of supplying that fear which is the mother of devotion,&mdash;at least
in the many millions of illogical eyes into which priests can still
look without laughing.</p>
<p>Such, in brief outline, has been the interaction of moral and
intellectual forces operating within the limits of established systems,
and of the nations governed by them. But there are added factors,
intensifying the forces on each side, when alien are brought into
rivalry and collision with national deities. In such a contest, besides
the moral and spiritual sentiments and the household sanctities, which
have become intertwined with the internal deities, national pride is
also enlisted, and patriotism. But on the other side is enlisted the
charm of novelty, and the consciousness of fault and failure in the
home system. Every system imported to a foreign land leaves behind its
practical shortcomings, puts its best foot forward&mdash;namely, its
theoretical foot&mdash;and has the advantage of suggesting a way of
escape from the existing routine which has become oppressive. Napoleon
I. said that no people profoundly attached to the institutions of their
country can be conquered; but what people are attached to the priestly
system over them? That internal dissatisfaction which, in secular
government, gives welcome to a dashing Corsican or a Prince of Orange,
has been the means of introducing many an alien religion, and giving to
many a prophet the honour denied him in his own country. Buddha was a
Hindu, but the triumph of his religion is not in India; Zoroaster was a
Persian, but there are no Parsees in Persia; Christianity is hardly a
colonist even in the native land of Christ.</p>
<p>These combinations and changes were not effected without fierce
controversies, ferocious wars, or persecutions, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb19" href="#v2pb19" name=
"v2pb19">19</a>]</span>and the formation of many devils. Nothing is
more normal in ancient systems than the belief that the gods of other
nations are devils. The slaughter of the priests of Baal corresponds
with the development of their god into Beelzebub. In proportion to the
success of Olaf in crushing the worshippers of Odin, their deity is
steadily transformed to a diabolical Wild Huntsman. But here also the
forces of partial recovery, which we have seen operating in the outcome
of internal reform, manifest themselves; the vanquished, and for a time
outlawed deity, is, in many cases, subsequently conciliated and given
an inferior, and, though hateful, a useful office in the new order.
Sometimes, indeed, as in the case of the Hindu destroyer Siva, it is
found necessary to assign a god, anathematised beyond all power of
whitewash, to an equal rank with the most virtuous deity. Political
forces and the exigencies of propagandism work many marvels of this
kind, which will meet us in the further stages of our
investigation.</p>
<p>Every superseded god who survives in subordination to another is
pretty sure to be developed into a Devil. Euphemism may tell pleasant
fables about him, priestcraft may find it useful to perpetuate belief
in his existence, but all the evils of the universe, which it is
inconvenient to explain, are gradually laid upon him, and sink him
down, until nothing is left of his former glory but a shining name.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Any one who has witnessed Mr. Henry Irving&rsquo;s
scholarly and masterly impersonation of the character of Louis XI. has
had an opportunity of recognising a phase of superstition which happily
it were now difficult to find off the stage. Nothing could exceed the
fine realism with which that artist brought before the spectator the
perfected type of a pretended religion from which all moral features
have been eliminated by such slow processes that the final success is
unconsciously reached, and the horrible result appears unchecked by
even any affectation of actual virtue. We see the king at sound of a
bell pausing in his instructions for a treacherous assassination to
mumble his prayers, and then instantly reverting to the villany over
whose prospective success he gloats. In the secrecy of his chamber no
mask falls, for there is no mask; the face of superstition and vice on
which we look is the real face which the ages of fanaticism have
transmitted to him.</p>
<p>Such a face has oftener been that of a nation than that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb21" href="#v2pb21" name="v2pb21">21</a>]</span>of
an individual, for the healthy forces of life work amid the homes and
hearts of mankind long before their theories are reached and
influenced. Such a face it was against which the moral insurrection
which bears the name of Zoroaster arose, seeing it as physiognomy of
the Evil Mind, naming it Ahriman, and, in the name of the conscience,
aiming at it the blow which is still felt across the centuries.</p>
<p>Ingenious theorists have accounted for the Iranian philosophy of a
universal war between Ormuzd (Ahuramazda) the Good, and Ahriman
(Angromainyus) the Evil, by vast and terrible climatic changes,
involving extremes of heat and cold, of which geologists find traces
about Old Iran, from which a colony of Aryans migrated to New Iran, or
Persia. But although physical conditions of this character may have
supplied many of the metaphors in which the conflict between Good and
Evil is described in the Avesta, there are other characteristics of
that ancient scripture which render it more probable that the early
colonisation of Persia was, like that of New England, the result of a
religious struggle. Some of the gods most adored in India reappear as
execrated demons in the religion of Zoroaster; the Hindu word for god
is the Pars&icirc; word for devil. These antagonisms are not merely
verbal; they are accompanied in the Avesta with the most furious
denunciations of theological opponents, whom it is not difficult to
identify with the priests and adherents of the Brahman religion.</p>
<p>The spirit of the early scriptures of India leaves no room for doubt
as to the point at which this revolution began. It was against pious
Privilege. The saintly hierarchy of India were a caste quite
irresponsible to moral laws. The ancient gods, vague names for the
powers of nature, were strictly limited in their dispensations to those
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb22" href="#v2pb22" name=
"v2pb22">22</a>]</span>of their priests;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e8220src" href="#xd20e8220" name="xd20e8220src">1</a> and as to
these priests the chief necessities were ample offerings, sacrifices,
and fulfilment of the ceremonial ordinances in which their authority
was organised, these were the performances rewarded by a reciprocal
recognition of authority. To the image of this political r&eacute;gime,
theology, always facile, accommodated the regulations of the gods. The
moral law can only live by being supreme; and as it was not supreme in
the Hindu pantheon, it died out of it. The doctrine of
&lsquo;merits,&rsquo; invented by priests purely for their own power,
included nothing meritorious, humanly considered; the merits consisted
of costly sacrifices, rich offerings to temples, tremendous penances
for fictitious sins, ingeniously devised to aggrandise the penances
which disguised power, and prolonged austerities that might be
comfortably commuted by the wealthy. When this doctrine had obtained
general adherence, and was represented by a terrestrial government
corresponding to it, the gods were necessarily subject to it. That were
only to say that the powers of nature were obedient to the
&lsquo;merits&rsquo; of privileged saints; and from this it is an
obvious inference that they are relieved from moral laws binding on the
vulgar.</p>
<p>The legends which represent this phase of priestly dominion are
curiously mixed. It would appear that under the doctrine of
&lsquo;merits&rsquo; the old gods declined. Such appears to be the
intimation of the stories which report the distress of the gods through
the power of human saints. The Rajah Ravana acquired such power that he
was said to have arrested the sun and moon, and so <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb23" href="#v2pb23" name=
"v2pb23">23</a>]</span>oppressed the gods that they temporarily
transformed themselves to monkeys in order to destroy him. Though
Visw&aacute;mitra murders a saint, his merits are such that the gods
are in great alarm lest they become his menials; and the completeness,
with which moral considerations are left out of the struggle on both
sides is disclosed in the item that the gods commissioned a nymph to
seduce the saintly murderer, and so reduce a little the force of his
austerities. It will be remembered that the ancient struggle of the
Devas and Asuras was not owing to any moral differences, but to an
alleged unfair distribution of the ambrosia produced by their joint
labours in churning the ocean. The fact that the gods cheated the
demons on that occasion was never supposed to affect the supremacy they
acquired by the treachery; and it could, therefore, cause no scandal
when later legends reported that the demons were occasionally able to
take gods captive by the practice of these wonderful
&lsquo;merits&rsquo; which were so independent of morals. One Asura is
said to have gained such power in this way that he subjugated the gods,
and so punished them that Siva, who had originally endowed that demon,
called into being Scanda, a war-god, to defend the tortured deities.
The most ludicrous part of all is that the gods themselves were
gradually reduced to the necessity of competing like others for these
tremendous powers; thus the Bhagavat Purana states that Brahma was
enabled to create the universe by previously undergoing penance for
sixteen thousand years.</p>
<p>The legends just referred to are puranic, and consequently of much
later date than the revolution traceable in the Iranian religion; but
these later legends are normal growths from vedic roots. These were the
principles of ancient theology, and the foundation of priestly
government. In view of them we need not wonder that Hindu <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb24" href="#v2pb24" name=
"v2pb24">24</a>]</span>theology devised no special devil; almost any of
its gods might answer the purposes of one. Nor need we be surprised
that it had no particular hell; any society organised by the sanctions
of religion, but irresponsible to its moral laws, would render it
unnecessary to look far for a hell.</p>
<p>From this cosmological chaos the more intelligent Hindus were of
course liberated; but the degree to which the fearful training had
corrupted the moral tissues of those who had been subjected to it was
revealed in the bald principle of their philosophers, that the
superstition must continue to be imposed on the vulgar, whilst the
learned might turn all the gods into a scientific terminology.</p>
<p>The first clear and truthful eye that touched that system would
transform it from a Heaven to an Inferno. So was it changed under the
eye of Zoroaster. That ancient pantheon which had become a refuge for
all the lies of the known world; whose gods were liars and their
supporters liars; was now turned into a realm of organised disorder, of
systematised wrong; a vast creation of wickedness, at whose centre sat
its creator and inspirer, the immoral god, the divine
devil&mdash;Ahriman.</p>
<p>It is indeed impossible to ascertain how far the revolt against the
old Brahmanic system was political. It is, of course, highly improbable
that any merely speculative system would excite a revolution; but at
the same time it must be remembered that, in early days, an importance
was generally attached to even abstract opinions such as we still find
among the superstitious who regard an atheistic sentiment as worse than
a theft. However this may have been, the Avesta does not leave us in
any doubt as to the main fact,&mdash;namely, that at a certain time and
place man came to a point where he had to confront antagonism to
fundamental moral principles, and that he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb25" href="#v2pb25" name="v2pb25">25</a>]</span>found the so-called
gods against him. In the establishment of those principles priests
recognised their own disestablishment. What those moral laws that had
become necessary to society were is also made clear. &lsquo;We worship
the Pure, the Lord of Purity!&rsquo; &lsquo;We honour the good spirit,
the good kingdom, the good law,&mdash;all that is good.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Evil doctrine shall not again destroy the world.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Good is the thought, good the word, good the deed, of the pure
Zarathustra.&rsquo; &lsquo;In the beginning the two heavenly Ones
spoke&mdash;the Good to the Evil&mdash;thus: Our souls, doctrines,
words, works, do not unite together.&rsquo; These sentences are from
the oldest G&acirc;th&acirc;s of the Avesta.</p>
<p>The following is a very ancient G&acirc;th&acirc;:&mdash;&lsquo;All
your Devas (Hindu &lsquo;gods&rsquo;) are only manifold children of the
Evil Mind, and the great One who worships the Saoma of lies and
deceits; besides the treacherous acts for which you are notorious in
the Seven Regions of the earth. You have invented all the evil that men
speak and do, which is indeed pleasant to the Devas, and is devoid of
all goodness, and therefore perishes before the insight of the truth of
the wise. Thus you defraud men of their good minds and of their
immortality by your evil minds&mdash;as well by those of the Devas as
through that of the Evil Spirit&mdash;through evil deeds and evil
words, whereby the power of liars grows.</p>
<p>&lsquo;1. Come near, and listen to the wise sayings of the
omniscient, the songs in praise of the Living One, and the prayers of
the Good Spirit, the glorious truths whose origin is seen in the
flames.</p>
<p>&lsquo;2. Listen, therefore, to the Earth spirit&mdash;Look at the
flames with reverent mind. Every one, man and woman, is to be
distinguished according to his belief. Ye ancient Powers, watch and be
with us!</p>
<p>&lsquo;3. From the beginning there were two Spirits, each
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb26" href="#v2pb26" name=
"v2pb26">26</a>]</span>active in itself. They are the good and the bad
in thought, word, and deed. Choose ye between them: do good, not
evil!</p>
<p>&lsquo;4. And these two Spirits meet and create the first existence,
the earthy, that which is and that which is not, and the last, the
spiritual. The worst existence is for the liars, the best for the
truthful.</p>
<p>&lsquo;5. Of these two spirits choose ye one, either the lying, the
worker of Evil, or the true holiest spirit. Whoso chooses the first
chooses the hardest fate; whoso the last, honours Ahuramazda in faith
and in truth by his deeds.</p>
<p>&lsquo;6. Ye cannot serve both of these two. An evil spirit whom we
will destroy surprises those who deliberate, saying, Choose the Evil
Mind! Then do those spirits gather in troops to attack the two lives of
which the prophets prophesy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;7. And to this earthly life came Armaiti with earthly power
to help the truth, and the good disposition: she, the Eternal, created
the material world, but the Spirit is with thee, O Wise One! the first
of creations in time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;8. When any evil falls upon the spirit, thou, O Wise One,
givest temporal possessions and a good disposition; but him whose
promises are lies, and not truth, thou punishest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Around the hymns of the Avesta gradually grew a theology and a
mythology which were destined to exert a powerful influence on the
world. These are contained in the Bundehesch.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e8277src" href="#xd20e8277" name="xd20e8277src">2</a> Anterior to
all things and all beings was Zeruane-Akrene (&lsquo;Boundless
Time&rsquo;), so exalted that he can only be worshipped in silence.
From him emanated two Ferouers, spiritual types, which took form in two
beings, Ormuzd and Ahriman. These were equally <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb27" href="#v2pb27" name=
"v2pb27">27</a>]</span>pure; but Ahriman became jealous of his
first-born brother, Ormuzd. To punish Ahriman for his evil feeling, the
Supreme Being condemned him to 12,000 years&rsquo; imprisonment in an
empire of rayless Darkness. During that period must rage the conflict
between Light and Darkness, Good and Evil. As Ormuzd had his
pre-existing type or Ferouer, so by a similar power&mdash;much the same
as the Platonic Logos or Word&mdash;he created the pure or spiritual
world, by means of which the empire of Ahriman should be overthrown. On
the earth (still spiritual) he raised the exceeding high mountain
Albordj, Elburz (snow mountain),<a class="noteref" id="xd20e8282src"
href="#xd20e8282" name="xd20e8282src">3</a> on whose summit he fixed
his throne; whence he stretched the bridge Chinevat, which, passing
directly over Duzhak, the abyss of Ahriman (or hell), reaches to the
portal of Gorodman, or heaven. All this was but a Ferouer world&mdash;a
prototype of the material world. In anticipation of its incorporation
in a material creation, Ormuzd (by emanations) created in his own image
six Amshaspands, or agents, of both sexes, to be models of perfection
to lower spirits&mdash;and to mankind, when they should be
created&mdash;and offer up their prayers to himself. The second series
of emanations were the Izeds, benevolent genii and guardians of the
world, twenty-eight in number, of whom the chief is Mithras, the
Mediator. The third series of emanations were the innumerable Ferouers
of things and men&mdash;for each must have its <i>soul</i>, which shall
purify them in the day of resurrection. In antagonism to all these,
Ahriman produced an exactly similar host of dark and evil powers. These
Devas rise, rank on rank, to their Arch-Devs&mdash;each of whom is
chained to his planet&mdash;and their head is Ash-Mogh, the
&lsquo;two-footed serpent of lies,&rsquo; who seems to correspond to
Mithras, the divine Mediator. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb28"
href="#v2pb28" name="v2pb28">28</a>]</span></p>
<p>After a reign of 3000 years Ormuzd entered on the work of realising
his spiritual emanations in a material universe. He formed the sun as
commander-in-chief, the moon as his lieutenant, the planets as captains
of a great host&mdash;the stars&mdash;who were soldiers in his war
against Ahriman. The dog Sirius he set to watch at the bridge Chinevat
(the Milky Way), lest thereby Ahriman should scale the heavens. Ormuzd
then created earth and water, which Ahriman did not try to prevent,
knowing that darkness was inherent in these. But he struck a blow when
life was produced. This was in form of a Bull, and Ahriman entered it
and it perished; but on its destruction there came out of its left
shoulder the seed of all clean and gentle animals, and, out of its
right shoulder&mdash;Man.</p>
<p>Ahriman had matched every creation thus far; but to make man was
beyond his power, and he had no recourse but to destroy him. However,
when the original man was destroyed, there sprang from his body a tree
which bore the first human pair, whom Ahriman, however, corrupted in
the manner elsewhere described.</p>
<p>It is a very notable characteristic of this Iranian theology, that
although the forces of good and evil are co-extensive and formally
balanced, in potency they are not quite equal. The balance of force is
just a little on the side of the Good Spirit. And this advantage
appears in man. Zoroaster said, &lsquo;No earthly man with a
hundredfold strength does so much evil as Mithra with heavenly strength
does good;&rsquo; and this thought reappears in the Pars&icirc; belief
that the one part of paradisiac purity, which man retained after his
fall, balances the ninety-nine parts won by Ahriman, and in the end
will redeem him. For this one divine ray preserved enables him to
receive and obey the Avesta, and to climb to heaven by the stairway of
three vast steps&mdash;pure thought, pure word, pure deed. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb29" href="#v2pb29" name=
"v2pb29">29</a>]</span>The optimistic essence of the mythology is
further shown in the belief that every destructive effort of Ahriman
resulted in a larger benefit than Ormuzd had created. The Bull (Life)
destroyed, man and animal sprang into being; the man destroyed, man and
woman appeared. And so on to the end. In the last quarter of the 12,000
years for which Ahriman was condemned, he rises to greater power even
than Ormuzd, and finally he will, by a fiery comet, set the visible
universe in conflagration; but while this scheme is waxing to
consummation Ormuzd will send his holy Prophet Sosioch, who will
convert mankind to the true law,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e8301src"
href="#xd20e8301" name="xd20e8301src">4</a> so that when
Ahriman&rsquo;s comet consumes the earth he will really be purifying
it. Through the vast stream of melted metals and minerals the righteous
shall pass, and to them it will be as a bath of warm milk: the wicked
in attempting to pass shall be swept into the abyss of Duzhak; having
then suffered three days and nights, they shall be raised by Ormuzd
refined and purified. Duzhak itself shall be purified by this fire, and
last of all Ahriman himself shall ascend to his original purity and
happiness. Then from the ashes of the former world shall bloom a
paradise that shall remain for ever.</p>
<p>In this system it is notable that we find the monster serpent of
vedic mythology, Ahi, transformed into an infernal region, Duzhak. The
dragon, being a type of physical suffering, passes away in Iranian as
in the later Semitic mythology before the new form, which represents
the stings of conscience though it may be beneath external pleasure. In
this respect, therefore, Ahriman fulfils the definition of a devil
already given. In the Avesta he fulfils also another condition
essential to a devil, the love of evil in and for itself. But in the
later theology it will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb30" href=
"#v2pb30" name="v2pb30">30</a>]</span>be observed that evil in Ahriman
is not organic. The war being over and its fury past, the hostile chief
is seen not so black as he had been painted; the belief obtains that he
does not actually love darkness and evil. He was thrust into them as a
punishment for his jealousy, pride, and destructive ambition. And
because that dark kingdom was a punishment&mdash;therefore not
congenial&mdash;it was at length (the danger past) held to be
disciplinary. Growing faith in the real supremacy of Good discovers the
immoral god to be an exaggerated anthropomorphic egoist; this divine
devil is a self-centred potentate who had attempted to subordinate
moral law and human welfare to his personal ascendancy. His fate having
sealed the sentence on all ambitions of that character, humanity is
able to pardon the individual offender, and find a hope that Ahriman,
having learned that no real satisfaction for a divine nature can be
found in mere power detached from rectitude, will join in the harmony
of love and loyalty at last. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb31"

ceremonial law; any general belief that morality is more acceptable to
gods than ceremonies must be fatal to those occult and fictitious
virtues which hedge about every pious impostor. Sacerdotal power in
India depended on superstitions carefully fostered <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb32" href="#v2pb32" name=
"v2pb32">32</a>]</span>concerning the mystical properties of a
stimulating juice (soma), litanies, invocations, and benedictions by
priests; upon sacrifices to the gods, including their priests,
austerities, penances, pilgrimages, and the like; one characteristic
running through all the performances&mdash;their utter worthlessness to
any being in the universe except the priest. An artificial system of
this kind has to create its own materials, and evoke forces of
evolution from many regions of nature. It is a process requiring much
more than the wisdom of the serpent and more than its harmfulness; and
there is a bit of nature&rsquo;s irony in the fact that when the
Brahman Rishi gained supremacy, the Cobra was also worshipped as
belonging to precisely the same caste and sanctity.</p>
<p>There are traces of long and fierce struggles preceding this
consummation. Even in the Vedic age&mdash;in the very dawn of religious
history&mdash;Tetzel appears with his indulgences and Luther confronts
him. The names they bore in ancient India were Visw&aacute;mitra and
Vasishtha. Both of these were among the seven powerful Rishis who made
the hierarchy of India in the earliest age known to us. Both were
composers of some of the chief hymns of the Vedas, and their respective
hymns bear the stamp of the sacerdotal and the anti-sacerdotal parties
which contended before the priestly sway had reached its complete
triumph. Visw&aacute;mitra was champion of the high priestly party and
its political pretensions. In the Rig-Veda there are forty hymns
ascribed to him and his family, nearly all of which celebrate the
divine virtues of Soma-juice and the Soma-sacrifice. As the exaltation
of the priestly caste in Israel was connected with a miracle, in which
the Jordan stopped flowing till the ark had been carried over, so the
rivers Sutledge and Reyah were said to have rested from their course
when Visw&aacute;mitra <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb33" href=
"#v2pb33" name="v2pb33">33</a>]</span>wished to cross them in seeking
the Soma. This Rishi became identified in the Hindu mind for all time
with political priestcraft. On the other hand, Vasishtha became equally
famous for his hostility to that power, as well as for his profoundly
religious character,&mdash;the finest hymns of the Vedas, as to moral
feeling, being those that bear his name. The anti-sacerdotal spirit of
Vasishtha is especially revealed in a strange satirical hymn in which
he ridicules the ceremonial Br&aacute;hmans under the guise of a
panegyric on frogs. In this composition occur such verses as
these:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like Br&aacute;hmans at the Soma-sacrifice of Atir&acirc;tra,
sitting round a full pond and talking, you, O frogs, celebrate this day
of the year when the rainy season begins.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These Br&aacute;hmans, with their Soma, have had their say,
performing the annual rite. These Adhwaryus, sweating while they carry
the hot pots, pop out like hermits.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They have always observed the order of the gods as they are
to be worshipped in the twelvemonth; these men do not neglect their
season....</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cow-noise gave, Goat-noise gave, the Brown gave, and the
Green gave us treasures. The frogs, who give us hundreds of cows,
lengthened our life in the rich autumn.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e8336src" href="#xd20e8336" name="xd20e8336src">1</a></p>
<p>Visw&aacute;mitra and Vasishtha appear to have been powerful rivals
in seeking the confidence of King Sud&aacute;s, and from their varying
fortunes came the tremendous feud between them which plays so large a
part in the traditions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb34" href=
"#v2pb34" name="v2pb34">34</a>]</span>of India. The men were both
priests, as are both ritualists and broad-churchmen in the present day.
They were borne on the stream of mythologic evolution to representative
regions very different from any they could have contemplated.
Vasishtha, ennobled by the moral sentiment of ages, appears as the
genius of truth and justice, maintaining these as of more
&lsquo;merit&rsquo; than any ceremonial perfections. The
Br&aacute;hmans, whom he once ridiculed, were glad enough in the end to
make him their patron saint, though they did not equally honour his
principles. On the other hand, Visw&aacute;mitra became the type of
that immoral divinity which received its Iranian anathema in Ahriman.
The murder he commits is nothing in a personage whose Soma-celebrations
have raised him so high above the trivialities of morality.</p>
<p>It is easy to see what must be the further development of such a
type as Visw&aacute;mitra when he shall have passed from the guarded
pages of puranic tradition to the terrible simplicities of folklore.
The saint whose majesty is built on &lsquo;merits,&rsquo; which have no
relation to what the humble deem virtues, naturally holds such virtues
in cynical contempt; naturally also he is indignant if any one dares to
suggest that the height he has reached by costly and prolonged
observances may be attained by poor and common people through the
practice of virtue. The next step is equally necessary. Since it is
hard to argue down the facts of human nature, Vasishtha is pretty sure
to have a strong, if sometimes silent, support for his heretical theory
of a priesthood representing virtue; consequently Visw&aacute;mitra
will be reduced at length to deny the existence of virtue, and will
become the Accuser of those to whom virtues are attributed. Finally,
from the Accuser to the Tempter the transition is inevitable. The
public Accuser must try and make good his case, and if the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb35" href="#v2pb35" name=
"v2pb35">35</a>]</span>facts do not support it, he must create other
facts which will, or else bear the last brand of his
tribe&mdash;Slanderer.</p>
<p>Leaving out of sight all historical or probable facts concerning
Visw&aacute;mitra and Vasishtha, but remembering the spirit of them,
let us read the great Passion-play of the East, in which their
respective parts are performed again as intervening ages have
interpreted them. The hero of this drama is an ancient king named
Hari&#347;chandra, who, being childless, and consequently unable to
gain immortality, promised the god Varuna to sacrifice to him a son if
one were granted him. The son having been born, the father beseeches
Varuna for respite, which is granted again and again, but stands firmly
by his promise, although it is finally commuted. The repulsive features
of the ancient legend are eliminated in the drama, the promise now
being for a vast sum of money which the king cannot pay, but which
Visw&aacute;mitra would tempt him to escape by a technical fiction. Sir
Mutu Cum&aacute;ra Sw&aacute;my, whose translation I follow, presents
many evidences of the near relation in which this drama stands to the
religious faith of the people in Southern India and parts of Ceylon,
where its representation never fails to draw vast crowds from every
part of the district in which it may occur, the impression made by it
being most profound.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e8356src" href=
"#xd20e8356" name="xd20e8356src">2</a></p>
<p>We are first introduced to Hari&#347;chandra, King of Ay&ograve;diah
(Oude), in his palace, surrounded by every splendour, and by the
devotion of his prosperous people. His first <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb36" href="#v2pb36" name=
"v2pb36">36</a>]</span>word is an ascription to the &lsquo;God of
gods.&rsquo; His ministers come forward and recount the wealth and
welfare of the nation. The first Act witnesses the marriage of
Hari&#347;chandra with the beautiful princess Chandravat&iacute;, and
it closes with the birth of a son.</p>
<p>The second Act brings us into the presence of Indra in the Abode of
the Gods. The Chief enters the Audience Hall of his palace, where an
assembly of deities and sages has awaited him. These sages are holy men
who have acquired supernatural power by their tremendous austerities;
and of these the most august is Visw&aacute;mitra. By the magnitude and
extent of his austerities he has gained a power beyond even that of the
Triad, and can reduce the worlds to cinders. All the gods court his
favour. As the Council proceeds, Indra addresses the
sages&mdash;&lsquo;Holy men! as gifted with supernatural attributes,
you roam the universe with marvellous speed, there is no place unknown
to you. I am curious to learn who, in the present times, is the most
virtuous sovereign on the earth below. What chief of mortals is there
who has never told a lie&mdash;who has never swerved from the course of
justice?&rsquo; Vasishtha, a powerful sage and family-priest of
Hari&#347;chandra, declares that his royal disciple is such a man. But
the more powerful Visw&aacute;mitra denounces Hari&#347;chandra as
cruel and a liar. The quarrel between the two Rishis waxes fierce,
until Indra puts a stop to it by deciding that an experiment shall be
made on Hari&#347;chandra. Vasishtha agrees that if his disciple can be
shown to have told a lie, or can be made to tell one, the fruit of his
life-long austerities, and all the power so gained, shall be added to
Visw&aacute;mitra; while the latter must present his opponent with half
of his &lsquo;merits&rsquo; if Hari&#347;chandra be not made to swerve
from the truth. Visw&aacute;mitra is to employ any means whatever,
neither Indra or any other interfering. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb37" href="#v2pb37" name="v2pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>Visw&aacute;mitra sets about his task of trying and tempting
Hari&#347;chandra by informing that king that, in order to perform a
sacrifice of special importance, he has need of a mound of gold as high
as a missile slung by a man standing on an elephant&rsquo;s back. With
the demand of so sacred a being Hari&#347;chandra has no hesitation in
complying, and is about to deliver the gold when Visw&aacute;mitra
requests him to be custodian of the money for a time, but perform the
customary ceremony of transfer. Holding Hari&#347;chandra&rsquo;s
written promise to deliver the gold whensoever demanded,
Visw&aacute;mitra retires with compliments. Then wild beasts ravage
Hari&#347;chandra&rsquo;s territory; these being expelled, a demon boar
is sent, but is vanquished by the monarch. Visw&aacute;mitra then sends
unchaste dancing-girls to tempt Hari&#347;chandra; and when he has
ordered their removal, Visw&aacute;mitra returns with them, and,
feigning rage, accuses him of slaying innocent beasts and of cruelty to
the girls. He declares that unless Hari&#347;chandra yields to the
Pariah damsels, he himself shall be reduced to a Pariah slave.
Hari&#347;chandra offers all his kingdom and possessions if the demand
is withdrawn, absolutely refusing to swerve from his virtue. This
Visw&aacute;mitra accepts, is proclaimed sovereign of Ay&ograve;diah,
and the king goes forth a beggar with his wife and child. But now, as
these are departing, Visw&aacute;mitra demands that mound of gold which
was to be paid when called for. In vain Hari&#347;chandra pleads that
he has already delivered up all he possesses, the gold included; the
last concession is declared to have nothing to do with the first. Yet
Visw&aacute;mitra says he will be charitable; if Hari&#347;chandra will
simply declare that he never pledged the gold, or, having done so, does
not feel bound to pay it, he will cancel that debt. &lsquo;Such a
declaration I can never make,&rsquo; replies Hari&#347;chandra.
&lsquo;I owe thee the gold, and pay it I shall. Let a messenger
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb38" href="#v2pb38" name=
"v2pb38">38</a>]</span>accompany me and leave me not till I have given
him thy due.&rsquo;</p>
<p>From this time the efforts of Visw&aacute;mitra are directed to
induce Hari&#347;chandra to declare the money not due. Amid his
heartbroken people&mdash;who cry, &lsquo;Where are the gods? Can they
tolerate this?&rsquo;&mdash;he who was just now the greatest and
happiest monarch in the world goes forth on the highway a wanderer with
his Chandravat&iacute; and their son Devar&aacute;ta dressed in
coarsest garments. His last royal deed is to set the crown on his
tempter&rsquo;s head. The people and officers follow, and beg his
permission to slay Visw&aacute;mitra, but he rebukes them, and counsels
submission. Visw&aacute;mitra orders a messenger, Nakshatra, to
accompany the three wretched ones, and inflict the severest sufferings
on them until the gold is paid, and amid each ordeal to offer
Hari&#347;chandra all his former wealth and happiness if he will utter
a falsehood.</p>
<p>They come to a desert whose sands are so hot that the wife faints.
Hari&#347;chandra bears his son in his arms, but in addition is
compelled to bear Nakshatra (the Br&aacute;hman and tormentor) on his
shoulders. They so pass amid snakes and scorpions, and receive terrible
stings; they pass through storm and flood, and yet vainly does
Nakshatra suggest the desired falsehood.</p>
<p>Then follows the ordeal of Demons, which gives an interesting
insight into Tamil Demonology. One of the company
exclaims&mdash;&lsquo;How frightful they look! Who can face them? They
come in battalions, young and old, small and great&mdash;all welcome
us. They disport themselves with a wild dance; flames shoot from their
mouths; their feet touch not the earth; they move in the air. Observe
you the bleeding corpses of human beings in their hands. They crunch
them and feed on the flesh. The place is one mass of gore and filth.
Wolves and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb39" href="#v2pb39" name=
"v2pb39">39</a>]</span>hy&aelig;nas bark at them; jackals and dogs
follow them. They are near. May Siva protect us!&rsquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Nakshatra.</span> How dreadful! Hari&#347;chandra,
what is this? Look! evil demons stare at me&mdash;I tremble for my
life. Protect me now, and I ask you no more for the gold.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hari&#347;chandra.</span> Have no fear, Nakshatra.
Come, place thyself in the midst of us.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Chief of the Goblins.</span> Men! little men! human
vermin! intrude ye thus into my presence? Know that, save only the
Br&aacute;hman standing in the midst of you, you are all my prey
to-night.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hari&#347;chandra.</span> Goblin! certainly thou
art not an evil-doer, for thou hast excepted this holy Br&aacute;hman.
As for ourselves, we know that the bodies which begin to exist upon
earth must also cease to exist on it. What matters it when death comes?
If he spares us now he reserves us only for another season. Good, kind
demon! destroy us then together; here we await our doom.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Nakshatra.</span> Hari&#347;chandra! before you
thus desert me, make the goblin promise you that he will not hurt
me.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hari&#347;chandra.</span> Thou hast no cause for
alarm; thou art safe.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Chief of the Goblins.</span> Listen! I find that
all four of you are very thin; it is not worth my while to kill you. On
examining closely, I perceive that the young Br&aacute;hman is plump
and fat as a wild boar. Give him up to me&mdash;I want not the
rest.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Nakshatra.</span> O Gods! O Hari&#347;chandra! you
are a great monarch! Have mercy on me! Save me, save me! I will never
trouble you for the gold, but treat you considerately hereafter.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hari&#347;chandra.</span> Sir, thy life is safe,
stand still. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb40" href="#v2pb40" name=
"v2pb40">40</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Nakshatra.</span> Allow me, sirs, to come closer to
you, and to hold you by the hand (<i>He grasps their hands.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hari&#347;chandra.</span> King of the Goblins! I
address thee in all sincerity; thou wilt confer on us a great favour
indeed by despatching us speedily to the Judgment Hall of the God of
Death. The Br&aacute;hman must not be touched; devour us.</p>
<p><span class="sc">The Goblin</span> (<i>grinding his teeth in great
fury</i>). What! dare you disobey me? Will you not deliver the
Br&aacute;hman?</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hari&#347;chandra.</span> No, we cannot. We alone
are thy victims.</p>
<p>[<i>Day breaks, and the goblins disappear.</i>]</p>
<p>Having thus withstood all temptation to harm his enemy, or to break
a promise he had given to treat him kindly, Hari&#347;chandra is again
pressed for the gold or the lie, and, still holding out, an ordeal of
fire follows. Trusting the God of Fire will cease to afflict if one is
sacrificed, Hari&#347;chandra prepares to enter the conflagration
first, and a pathetic contention occurs between him and his wife and
son as to which shall be sacrificed. In the end Hari&#347;chandra
rushes in, but does not perish.</p>
<p>Hari&#347;chandra is hoping to reach the temple of Vis
Wan&agrave;th<a class="noteref" id="xd20e8451src" href="#xd20e8451"
name="xd20e8451src">3</a> at Kasi and invoke his aid to pay the gold.
To the temple he comes only to plead in vain, and Nakshatra tortures
him with instruments. Finally Hari&#347;chandra, his wife and child,
are sold as slaves to pay the debt. But Visw&aacute;mitra, invisibly
present, only redoubles his persecutions. Hari&#347;chandra is
subjected to the peculiar degradation of having to burn dead bodies in
a cemetery. Chandravat&iacute; and her son are subjected to cruelties.
The boy is one day sent to the forest, is bitten by a snake, and dies.
Chandravat&iacute; goes out in the night to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb41" href="#v2pb41" name=
"v2pb41">41</a>]</span>find the body. She repairs with it to the
cemetery. In the darkness she does not recognise her husband, the
burner of the bodies, nor he his wife. He has strictly promised his
master that every fee shall be paid, and reproaches the woman for
coming in the darkness to avoid payment. Chandravat&iacute; offers in
payment a sacred chain which Siva had thrown round her neck at birth,
invisible to all but a perfect man. Hari&#347;chandra alone has ever
seen it, and now recognises his wife. But even now he will not perform
the last rites over his dead child unless the fee can be obtained as
promised. Chandravat&iacute; goes out into the city to beg the money,
leaving Hari&#347;chandra seated beside the dead body of
Devar&aacute;ta. In the street she stumbles over the corpse of another
child, and takes it up; it proves to be the infant Prince, who has been
murdered. Chandravat&iacute;&mdash;arrested and dragged before the
king&mdash;in a state of frenzy declares she has killed the child. She
is condemned to death, and her husband must be her executioner. But the
last scene must be quoted nearly in full.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Verakvoo</span> (<i>Hari&#347;chandra&rsquo;s

<p><span class="sc">Chandravat&iacute;</span> (<i>coming to

of this crime, there is no hope for your life; I must presently fulfil
my instructions. I can only allow you a few seconds; pray to your
tutelary deities, prepare yourself to meet your doom.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Visw&aacute;mitra</span> (<i>who has suddenly

<p><span class="sc">Hari&#347;chandra.</span> I pray, my lord, attempt
not to beguile me from the path of rectitude. Nothing shall shake my
resolution; even though thou didst offer to me the throne of Indra I

bear our ills meekly. Yes; let all men perish, let all gods cease to
exist, let the stars that shine above grow dim, let all seas be dried
up, let all mountains be levelled to the ground, let wars rage, blood

<p><span class="sc">Hari&#347;chandra.</span> All my misfortunes are of
little consequence, since thou, O God of gods, hast deigned to favour
me with thy divine presence. No longer care I for kingdom, or power, or

thy worship, to the redemption of my erring soul, I devote myself
uninterruptedly hereafter. Let me not become the sport of men. The
slave of a Pariah cannot become a king; the slave-girl of a

<p>The plot of this drama has probably done as much and as various duty
as any in the world. It has spread like a spiritual banyan, whose
branches, taking root, have swelled to such size that it is difficult
now to say which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb45" href="#v2pb45"
name="v2pb45">45</a>]</span>is the original trunk. It may even be that
the only root they all had in common is an invisible one in the human
heart, developed in its necessary struggles amid nature after the pure
and perfect life.</p>
<p>But neither in the Book of Job, which we are yet to consider, nor in
any other variation of the theme, does it rise so high as in this drama
of Hari&#347;chandra. In Job it represents man loyal to his deity amid
the terrible afflictions which that deity permits; but in
Hari&#347;chandra it shows man loyal to a moral principle even against
divine orders to the contrary. Despite the hand of the licenser, and
the priestly manipulations, visible here and there in
it&mdash;especially towards the close&mdash;sacerdotalism stands
confronted by its reaction at last, and receives its sentence in the
joy with which the Hindu sees the potent Rishis with all their
pretentious &lsquo;merits,&rsquo; and the gods themselves, kneeling at
the feet of the man who stands by Truth.</p>
<p>It is amusing to find the wincings of the priests through many
centuries embodied in a legend about Hari&#347;chandra after he went to
heaven. It is related that he was induced by N&aacute;rada to relate
his actions with such unbecoming pride that he was lowered from Svarga
(heaven) one stage after each sentence; but having stopped in time, and
paid homage to the gods, he was placed with his capital in mid-air,
where eyes sacerdotally actinised may still see the aerial city at
certain times. The doctrine of &lsquo;merits&rsquo; will no doubt be
able for some time yet to charge &lsquo;good deeds&rsquo; with their
own sin&mdash;pride; but, after all, the priest must follow the people
far enough to confess that one must look upward to find the martyr of
Truth. In what direction one must look to find his accuser requires no
further intimation than the popular legend of Visw&aacute;mitra.

Tables&mdash;Contradictions&mdash;Detachment of the Elohim from

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The sacred books of the Hebrews bring us into the
presence of the gods (Elohim) supposed to have created all things out
of nothing&mdash;nature-gods&mdash;just as they are in transition to
the conception of a single Will and Personality. Though the plural is
used (&lsquo;gods&rsquo;) a singular verb follows: the tendency is
already to that concentration which resulted in the enthronement of one
supreme sovereign&mdash;Jehovah. The long process of evolution which
must have preceded this conception is but slightly traceable in the
Bible. It is, however, written on the face of the whole world, and the
same process is going on now in its every phase. Whether with
Gesenius<a class="noteref" id="xd20e8599src" href="#xd20e8599" name=
"xd20e8599src">1</a> we take the sense of the word Elohim to be
&lsquo;the revered,&rsquo; or, with F&uuml;rst,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e8602src" href="#xd20e8602" name="xd20e8602src">2</a> &lsquo;the
mighty,&rsquo; makes little difference; the fact remains that the word
is applied elsewhere to gods in general, including such as were
afterwards deemed false gods by the Jews; and it is more important
still that the actions ascribed to the Elohim, who created the heavens
and the earth, generally reflect the powerful and un-moral forces of
nature. The work of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb47" href=
"#v2pb47" name="v2pb47">47</a>]</span>creation in Genesis (i. and ii.
1&ndash;3) is that of giants without any moral quality whatever.
Whether or not we take in their obvious sense the words, &lsquo;Elohim
created man in his own image, ... male and female created he
them,&rsquo; there can be no question of the meaning of Gen. vi. 1, 2:
&lsquo;The sons of Elohim saw the daughters of men that they were
beautiful, and they took to themselves for wives whomsoever they
chose.&rsquo; When good and evil come to be spoken of, the name
Jehovah<a class="noteref" id="xd20e8617src" href="#xd20e8617" name=
"xd20e8617src">3</a> at once appears. The Elohim appear again in the
Flood, the wind that assuaged it, the injunction to be fruitful and
multiply, the cloud and rainbow; and gradually the germs of a moral
government begin to appear in their assigning the violence of mankind
as reason for the deluge, and in the covenant with Noah. But even after
the name Jehovah had generally blended with, or even superseded, the
other, we find Elohim often used where strength and wonder-working are
thought of&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, &lsquo;Thou art the god that doest
wonders&rsquo; (Ps. lxxvii.). &lsquo;Thy way is in the sea, and thy
path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Against the primitive nature-deities the personality and jealous
supremacy of Jehovah was defined. The golden calf built by Aaron was
called Elohim (plural, though there was but one calf). Solomon was
denounced for building altars to the same; and when Jeroboam built
altars to two calves, they are still so called. Other
rivals&mdash;Dagon (Judges xvi.), Astaroth, Chemosh, Milcom (1 Kings
xi.)&mdash;are called by the once-honoured name. The English Bible
translates Elohim, God; Jehovah, the <span class="sc">Lord</span>;
Jehovah Elohim, the <span class="sc">Lord</span> God; and the critical
reader will find much that is significant in the varied use of these
names. Thus (Gen. xxii.) it is Elohim that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb48" href="#v2pb48" name=
"v2pb48">48</a>]</span>demands the sacrifice of Isaac, Jehovah that
interferes to save him. At the same time, in editing the story, it is
plainly felt to be inadmissible that Abraham should be supposed loyal
to any other god than Jehovah; so Jehovah adopts the sacrifice as meant
for himself, and the place where the ram was provided in place of Isaac
is called Jehovah-Jireh. However, when we can no longer distinguish the
two antagonistic conceptions by different names their actual
incongruity is even more salient, and, as we shall see, develops a
surprising result.</p>
<p>Jehovah inaugurates his reign by a manifesto against these giants,
the Elohim, for whom the special claim&mdash;clamorously asserted when
Aaron built the Golden Calf, and continued as the plea for the same
deity&mdash;was that <i>they</i> (Elohim) had brought Israel out of
Egypt. &lsquo;I,&rsquo; cries Jehovah, &lsquo;am the Lord thy God,
which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of
bondage: thou shalt have no other gods but me;&rsquo; and the first
four commandments of the law are devoted entirely to a declaration of
his majesty, his power (claiming credit for the creation), his jealous
determination to punish his opponents and reward his friends, to
vindicate the slightest disrespect to his name. The narrative of the
Golden Calf was plainly connected with Sinai in order to illustrate the
first commandment. The punishment of the believers in another divine
emancipator, even though they had not yet received the proclamation,
must be signal. Jehovah is so enraged that by his order human victims
are offered up to the number of three thousand, and even after that, it
is said, Jehovah plagued Israel on account of their Elohim-worship. In
the same direction is the command to keep holy the Sabbath day, because
on it he rested from the work of creation (Gen. xx.), or because on
that day he delivered Israel from Egypt (Deut. v.), the editors do not
seem to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb49" href="#v2pb49" name=
"v2pb49">49</a>]</span>remember exactly which, but it is well enough to
say both, for it is taking the two picked laurels from the brow of
Elohim and laying them on that of Jehovah. In all of which it is
observable that there is no moral quality whatever. Nero might equally
command the Romans to have no other gods before himself, to speak his
name with awe, to rest when he stopped working. In the fifth
commandment, arbitrarily ascribed to the First Table, we have a
transition to the moral code; though even there the honour of parents
is jealously associated with Jehovah&rsquo;s greatness (&lsquo;that thy
days may be long in the land which Jehovah Elohim giveth thee&rsquo;).
The nature-gods were equal to that; for the Elohim had begotten the
giants who were &lsquo;in the earth in those days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Elohim spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am Jehovah; and
I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob by (the name of)
God Almighty (<i>El-Shaddai</i>), but by my name <span class=
"sc">Jehovah</span> was I not known to them&rsquo; (Exod. vi. 2,
3).</p>
<p>The ancient gods&mdash;the Elohim&mdash;were, in the process of
absorption into the one great form, the repository of their several
powers, distinguishable; and though, for the most part, they bear names
related to the forces of nature, now and then they reflect the
tendencies to humanisation. Thus we have &lsquo;the most high
god&rsquo; (<i>El-elyon</i>&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Gen. xiv. 18);
&lsquo;the everlasting-god&rsquo; (<i>El-elim</i>, Gen. xxi. 33);
&lsquo;the jealous god&rsquo; (<i>El-kana</i>, Exod. xx. 5); &lsquo;the
mighty god, and terrible&rsquo; (<i>El-gadol</i> and <i>nora</i>, Deut.
vii. 21); &lsquo;the living god&rsquo; (<i>El-chi</i>, Josh. iii. 10);
&lsquo;the god of heaven&rsquo; (<i>El-shemim</i>, Ps. cxxxvi. 26); the
&lsquo;god almighty&rsquo; (<i>El-shaddai</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e8719src" href="#xd20e8719" name="xd20e8719src">4</a> Exod. vi.
2). These Elohim, with each of whose names I have referred to an
instance of its characteristic use, became <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb50" href="#v2pb50" name=
"v2pb50">50</a>]</span>epithets, as the powers they represented were
more and more absorbed by the growing personality of Jehovah; but these
epithets were also characters, and their historic expressions had also
to undergo a process of slow and difficult digestion. The all-devouring
grandeur of Jehovah showed what it had fed on. Not only all the
honours, but many of the dishonours, of the primitive deities adhered
to the sovereign whose rule was no doubt inaugurated by their disgrace
and their barbarism. The costliness of the glory of divine absolutism
is again illustrated in the evolution of the premature monotheism,
which had for its figure-head the dread Jehovah, who, as heir of the
nature-gods, became responsible for the monstrosities of a tribal
demonolatry, thus being compelled to fill simultaneously the
<i>r&ocirc;les</i> of the demon and the lawgiver.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The two tables of the law&mdash;one written by Jehovistic theology,
the other by the moral sense of mankind&mdash;ascribed to this dual
deity, for whom unity was so fiercely insisted on, may be read in their
outcome throughout the Bible. They are here briefly, in a few examples,
set forth side by side.</p>

<p>Instances of this discrepancy might be largely multiplied. Any one
who cares to pursue the subject can trace the building upon the
powerful personal Jehovah of a religion of human sacrifices, anathemas,
and priestly despotism; while around the moral ruler and judge of the
same name, whose personality is more and more dispersed in pantheistic
ascriptions, there grows the common law, and then the more moral law of
equity, and the corresponding sentiments which gradually evolve the
idea of a parental deity.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the more this second idea of the deity prevails,
the more he is regarded as &lsquo;merciful,&rsquo;
&lsquo;long-suffering,&rsquo; &lsquo;a God of truth and without
iniquity, just and right,&rsquo; &lsquo;delighting not in sacrifice but
mercifulness,&rsquo; &lsquo;good <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb53"
href="#v2pb53" name="v2pb53">53</a>]</span>to all,&rsquo; and whose
&lsquo;tender mercies are over all his works,&rsquo; and having
&lsquo;no pleasure in the death of him that dieth;&rsquo; the less will
it be possible to see in the very same being the &lsquo;man of
war,&rsquo; &lsquo;god of battles,&rsquo; the &lsquo;jealous,&rsquo;
&lsquo;angry,&rsquo; &lsquo;fire-breathing&rsquo; one, who
&lsquo;visits the sins of the fathers upon the children,&rsquo; who
laughs at the calamities of men and mocks when their fear cometh. It is
a structural necessity of the human mind that these two shall be
gradually detached the one from the other. From one of the Jehovahs
represented in parallel columns came the &lsquo;Father&rsquo; whom
Christ adored: from the other came the Devil he abhorred. <span class=

the fiery and cruel Elohim compared with those of the Devil&mdash;The
powers of evil combined under a head&mdash;Continuity&mdash;The
consuming fire spiritualised.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That Abraham was a Fire-worshipper might be suspected
from the immemorial efforts of all Semitic authorities to relieve him
of traditional connection with that particular idolatry. When the good
and evil powers were being distinguished, we find the burning and the
bright aspects of Fire severally regarded. The sign of Jehovah&rsquo;s
covenant with Abram included both. &lsquo;It came to pass that when the
sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace and a burning
lamp that passed between those pieces&rsquo; (of the sacrifice). In the
legend of Moses we have the glory resting on Sinai and the burning
bush, the bush which, it is specially remarked, was &lsquo;not
consumed,&rsquo; an exceptional circumstance in honour of Moses. To
these corresponded the Urim and Thummim, marking the priest as source
of light and of judgment. In his favourable and adorable aspect Jehovah
was the Brightness of Fire. This was the Shekinah. In the Targum,
Jonathan Ben Uzziel to the Prophets, it is said: &lsquo;The mountains
trembled before the Lord; the mountains Tabor, Hermon, Carmel said one
to the other: Upon me the Shekinah will rest, and to me will it come.
But the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb55" href="#v2pb55" name=
"v2pb55">55</a>]</span>Shekinah rested upon Mount Sinai, weakest and
smallest of all the mountains. This Sinai trembled and shook, and its
smoke went up as the smoke of an oven, because of the glory of the God
of Israel which had manifested itself upon it.&rsquo; The
Brightness<a class="noteref" id="xd20e8871src" href="#xd20e8871" name=
"xd20e8871src">1</a> passed on to illumine every event associated with
the divine presence in Semitic mythology; it was &lsquo;the glory of
the Lord&rsquo; shining from the Star of Bethlehem, and the figure of
the Transfiguration.</p>
<p>The Consuming Fire also had its development. Among the spiritual it
was spiritualised. &lsquo;Who among us shall dwell with the Devouring
Fire?&rsquo; cries Isaiah. &lsquo;Who among us shall dwell with the
Everlasting Burnings? He that walketh righteously and speaketh
uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his
hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of
blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil.&rsquo; It was by a
prosaic route that the Devouring Fire became the residence of the
wicked.</p>
<p>After Jeroboam (1 Kings xiii.) had built altars to the Elohim, under
form of Calves, a prophet came out of Judah to denounce the idolatry.
&lsquo;And he cried against the altar in the word of Jehovah, and said,
O altar, altar! thus saith Jehovah, Behold, a child shall be born unto
the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the
priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men&rsquo;s
bones shall be burnt upon thee.&rsquo; It was deemed so important that
this prophecy should be fulfilled in the letter, when it could no
longer be fulfilled in reality, that some centuries later Josiah dug up
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb56" href="#v2pb56" name=
"v2pb56">56</a>]</span>bones of the Elohistic priests and burned them
upon their long-ruined altars (2 Kings xxiii.).</p>
<p>The incident is significant, both on account of the prophet&rsquo;s
personification of the altar, and the institution of a sort of Gehenna
in connection with it. The personification and the Gehenna became much
more complete as time went on. The Jews originally had no Devil, as
indeed had no races at first; and this for the obvious reason that
their so-called gods were quite equal to any moral evils that were to
be accounted for, as we have already seen they were adequate to explain
all physical evils. But the antagonists of the moral Jehovah were
recognised and personified with increasing clearness, and were quite
prepared for connection with any General who might be theoretically
proposed for their leadership. When the Jews came under the influence
of Persian theology the archfiend was elected, and all the
Elohim&mdash;Moloch, Dagon, Astarte, Chemosh, and the rest&mdash;took
their place under his rebellious ensign.</p>
<p>The descriptions of the Devil in the Bible are mainly borrowed from
the early descriptions of the Elohim, and of Jehovah in his Elohistic
character.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e8893src" href="#xd20e8893" name=

<p>In addition to the above passages may be cited a notable passage
from Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to the Thessalonians (ii. 3). &lsquo;Let no
man deceive you by any means: for that day (of Christ) shall not come,
except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be
revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above
all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he, as God,
sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God. Remember
ye not that, when I was yet with you, I told you <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb59" href="#v2pb59" name=
"v2pb59">59</a>]</span>these things? And now ye know what withholdeth
that he might be revealed in his time. For the mystery of iniquity doth
already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out
of the way: and then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall
consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the
brightness of his coming: even him whose coming is after the working of
Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders, and with all the
deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they
received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for
this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should
believe a lie; that they all might be damned who believed not the
truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This remarkable utterance shows how potent was the survival in the
mind of Paul of the old Elohist belief. Although the ancient deity, who
deceived prophets to their destruction, and sent forth lying spirits
with their strong delusions, was dethroned and outlawed, he was still a
powerful claimant of empire, haunting the temple, and setting himself
up therein as God. He will be consumed by Christ&rsquo;s breath when
the day of triumph comes; but meanwhile he is not only allowed great
power in the earth, but utilised by the true God, who even so far
cooperates with the false as to send on some men &lsquo;strong
delusions&rsquo; (&lsquo;a working of error,&rsquo; Von Tischendorf
translates), in order that they may believe the lie and be damned. Paul
speaks of the &lsquo;mystery of iniquity;&rsquo; but it is not so very
mysterious when we consider the antecedents of his idea. The dark
problem of the origin of evil, and its continuance in the universe
under the rule of a moral governor, still threw its impenetrable shadow
across the human mind. It was a terrible reality, visible in the
indifference or hostility with which the new gospel was met on the part
of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb60" href="#v2pb60" name=
"v2pb60">60</a>]</span>cultured and powerful; and it could only then be
explained as a mysterious provisional arrangement connected with some
divine purpose far away in the depths of the universe. But the passage
quoted from Thessalonians shows plainly that all those early traditions
about the divinely deceived prophets and lying spirits, sent forth from
Jehovah Elohim, had finally, in Paul&rsquo;s time, become marshalled
under a leader, a personal Man of Sin; but this leader, while opposing
Christ&rsquo;s kingdom, is in some mysterious way a commissioner of
God.</p>
<p>We may remark here the beautiful continuity by which, through all
these shadows of terror and vapours of speculation, &lsquo;clouding the
glow of heaven,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e9069src" href=
"#xd20e9069" name="xd20e9069src">3</a> the unquenchable ideal from
first to last is steadily ascending.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One or three things,&rsquo; says the Talmud, &lsquo;were
before this world&mdash;Water, Fire, and Wind. Water begat the
Darkness, Fire begat Light, and Wind begat the Spirit of Wisdom.&rsquo;
This had become the rationalistic translation by a crude science of the
primitive demons, once believed to have created the heavens and the
earth. In the process we find the forces outlawed in their wild action,
but becoming the choir of God in their quiet action:&mdash;</p>
<p>1 Kings xix. 11&ndash;13. &lsquo;And he said, Go forth, and stand
upon the mount before the Lord. And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a
great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks
before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind
an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: and after the
earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire
a still small voice. And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he
wrapped his face in his mantle.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb61" href="#v2pb61" name="v2pb61">61</a>]</span></p>
<p>But man must have a philosophical as well as a moral development:
the human mind could not long endure this elemental anarchy. It asked,
If the Lord be not in the hurricane, the earthquake, the volcanic
flame, who <i>is</i> therein? This is the answer of the
Targum:<a class="noteref" id="xd20e9096src" href="#xd20e9096" name=
"xd20e9096src">4</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;And he said, Arise and stand on the mountain before the Lord.
And God revealed himself: and before him a host of angels of the wind,
cleaving the mountain and breaking the rocks before the Lord; but not
in the host of angels was the Shechinah. And after the host of the
angels of the wind came a host of angels of commotion; but not in the
host of the angels of commotion was the Shechinah of the Lord. And
after the angels of commotion came a host of angels of fire; but not in
the host of angels of fire was the Shechinah of the Lord. But after the
host of the angels of the fire came voices singing in silence. And it
was when Elijah heard this he hid his face in his mantle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The moral sentiment takes another step in advance with the unknown
but artistic writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews. Moses had described
God as a &lsquo;consuming fire;&rsquo; and &lsquo;the sight of the
glory of the Lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in
the eyes of the children of Israel&rsquo; (Exod. xxiv. 17). When next
we meet this phrase it is with this writer, who seeks to supersede what
Moses (traditionally) built up. &lsquo;Whose voice,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;then shook the earth; but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once
more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven. And this word,
&lsquo;yet once more,&rsquo; signifieth the removing of those things
that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those which cannot be
shaken may remain.... For our God is a consuming fire.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb62" href="#v2pb62" name=
"v2pb62">62</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Our</i> God also!&rsquo; cries each great revolution that
advances. His consuming wrath is not now directed against man, but the
errors which are man&rsquo;s only enemies: the lightnings of the new
Sinai, while they enlighten the earth, smite the old heaven of human
faith and imagination, shrivelling it like a burnt scroll!</p>
<p>In this nineteenth century, when the old heaven, amid which this
fiery pillar glowed, is again shaken, the ancient phrase has still its
meaning. The Russian Tourgenieff represents two friends who had studied
together in early life, then parted, accidentally meeting once more for
a single night. They compare notes as to what the long intervening
years have taught them; and one sums his experience in the
words&mdash;&lsquo;I have burned what I used to worship, and worship
what I used to burn.&rsquo; The novelist artfully reproduces for this
age a sentence associated with a crisis in the religious history of
Europe. Clovis, King of the Franks, invoked the God of his wife
Clotilda to aid him against the Germans, vowing to become a Christian
if successful; and when, after his victory, he was baptized at Rheims,
St. Remy said to him&mdash;&lsquo;Bow thy head meekly, Sicambrian; burn
what thou hast worshipped, and worship what thou hast burned!&rsquo;
Clovis followed the Bishop&rsquo;s advice in literal fashion, carrying
fire and sword amid his old friends the &lsquo;Pagans&rsquo; right
zealously. But the era has come in which that which Clovis&rsquo; sword
and St. Remy&rsquo;s theology set up for worship is being consumed in
its turn. Tourgenieff&rsquo;s youths are consuming the altar on which
their forerunners were consumed. And in this rekindled flame the world
now sees shrivelling the heavens once fresh, but now reflecting the
aggregate selfishness of mankind, the hells representing their
aggregate cowardice, and feeds its nobler faith with this vision of the
eternal fire which evermore consumes the false and refines the world.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Montfaucon has among his plates one (XX.) representing
an antique agate which he supposes to represent Zeus and Athena, but
which probably relates to the myth of Herakles and Athena in the garden
of Hesperides. The hero having penetrated this garden, slays the dragon
which guards its immortalising fruit, but when he has gathered this
fruit Athena takes it from him, lest man shall eat it and share the
immortality of the gods. In this design the two stand on either side of
the tree, around which a serpent is twined from root to branches. The
history which Montfaucon gives of the agate is of equal interest with
the design itself. It was found in an old French cathedral, where it
had long been preserved and shown as a holy picture of the Temptation.
It would appear also to have previously deceived some rabbins, for on
the border is written in Hebrew characters, much more modern than the
central figures, &lsquo;The woman saw that the tree was good for food,
and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make
one wise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This mystification about a design, concerning whose <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb64" href="#v2pb64" name=
"v2pb64">64</a>]</span>origin and design there is now no doubt, is
significant. The fable of Paradise and the Serpent is itself more
difficult to trace, so many have been the races and religions which
have framed it with their holy texts and preserved it in their sacred
precincts. In its essence, no doubt, the story grows from a universal
experience; in that aspect it is a mystical rose that speaks all
languages. When man first appears his counterpart is a garden. The
moral nature means order. The wild forces of nature&mdash;the
Elohim&mdash;build no fence, forbid no fruit. They say to man as the
supreme animal, Subdue the earth; every tree and herb shall be your
meat; every animal your slave; be fruitful and multiply. But from the
conflict the more real man emerges, and his sign is a garden hedged in
from the wilderness, and a separation between good and evil.</p>
<p>The form in which the legend appears in the Book of Genesis presents
one side in which it is simple and natural. This has already been
suggested (<a href="#v1pb330">vol. i. p. 330</a>). But the legend of
man defending his refuge from wild beasts against the most subtle of
them is here overlaid by a myth in which it plays the least part. The
mind which reads it by such light as may be obtained only from biblical
sources can hardly fail to be newly puzzled at every step. So much,
indeed, is confessed in the endless and diverse theological theories
which the story has elicited. What is the meaning of the curse on the
Serpent that it should for ever crawl thereafter? Had it not crawled
previously? Why was the Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil
forbidden? Why, when its fruit was tasted, should the Tree of Life have
been for the first time forbidden and jealously guarded? These riddles
are nowhere solved in the Bible, and have been left to the fanciful
inventions of theologians and the ingenuity of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb65" href="#v2pb65" name=
"v2pb65">65</a>]</span>rabbins. Dr. Adam Clarke thought the Serpent was
an ape before his sin, and many rabbins concluded he was camel-shaped;
but the remaining enigmas have been fairly given up.</p>
<p>The ancient Jews, they who wrote and compiled the Old Testament,
more candid than their modern descendants and our omniscient
christians, silently confessed their inability to make anything out of
this snake-story. From the third chapter of Genesis to the last verse
of Malachi the story is not once alluded to! Such a phenomenon would
have been impossible had this legend been indigenous with the Hebrew
race. It was clearly as a boulder among them which had floated from
regions little known to their earlier writers; after lying naked
through many ages, it became overgrown with rabbinical lichen and moss,
and, at the Christian era, while it seemed part of the Hebrew
landscape, it was exceptional enough to receive special reverence as a
holy stone. That it was made the corner-stone of Christian theology may
be to some extent explained by the principle of <i lang="la">omne
ignotum pro mirifico</i>. But the boulder itself can only be explained
by tracing it to the mythologic formation from which it crumbled.</p>
<p>How would a Parsi explain the curse on a snake which condemned it to
crawl? He would easily give us evidence that at the time when most of
those Hebrew Scriptures were written, without allusion to such a
Serpent, the ancient Persians believed that Ahriman had tempted the
first man and woman through his evil mediator, his anointed son,
Ash-Mogh, &lsquo;the two-footed Serpent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But let us pass beyond the Persian legend, carrying that and the
biblical story together, for submission to the criticism of a
Br&aacute;hman. He will tell us that this Ash-Mogh of the Parsi is
merely the ancient A&egrave;shma-da&eacute;va <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb66" href="#v2pb66" name="v2pb66">66</a>]</span>of
the Avesta, which in turn is Ahi, the great Vedic Serpent-monster whom
Indra &lsquo;prostrated beneath the feet&rsquo; of the stream he had
obstructed&mdash;every stream having its deity. He would remind us that
the Vedas describe the earliest dragon-slayer, Indra, as
&lsquo;crushing the head&rsquo; of his enemy, and that this figure of
the god with his heel on a Serpent&rsquo;s head has been familiar to
his race from time immemorial. And he would then tell us to read the
Rig-Veda, v. 32, and the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata, and we would find
all the elements of the story told in Genesis.</p>
<p>In the hymn referred to we find a graphic account of how, when Ahi
was sleeping on the waters he obstructed, Indra hurled at him his
thunderbolt. It says that when Indra had &lsquo;annihilated the weapon
of that mighty beast from him (Ahi), another, more powerful, conceiving
himself one and unmatched, was generated,&rsquo; This &lsquo;wrath-born
son,&rsquo; &lsquo;a walker in darkness,&rsquo; had managed to get hold
of the sacred Soma, the plant monopolised by the gods, and having drunk
this juice, he lay slumbering and <span class="corr" id="xd20e9150"
title="Not in source">&lsquo;</span>enveloping the world,&rsquo; and
then &lsquo;fierce Indra seized upon him,&rsquo; and having previously
discovered &lsquo;the vital part of him who thought, himself
invulnerable,&rsquo; struck that incarnation of many-formed Ahi, and he
was &lsquo;<i>made the lowest of all creatures</i>&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But one who has perused the philological biography of Ahi already
given, <a href="#v1pb357">vol. i. p. 357</a>, will not suppose that
this was the end of him. We must now consider in further detail the
great episode of the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata, to which reference has
been made in other connections.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e9161src"
href="#xd20e9161" name="xd20e9161src">1</a> During the Deluge the most
precious treasure of the gods, the Amrita, the ambrosia that rendered
them immortal, was lost, and the poem relates how the Devas and Asuras,
otherwise gods <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb67" href="#v2pb67"
name="v2pb67">67</a>]</span>and serpents, together churned the ocean
for it. There were two great mountains,&mdash;Meru the golden and
beautiful, adorned with healing plants, pleasant streams and trees,
unapproachable by the sinful, guarded by serpents; Mandar, rocky,
covered with rank vegetation, infested by savage beasts. The first is
the abode of the gods, the last of demons. To find the submerged Amrita
it was necessary to uproot Mandar and use it to churn the ocean. This
was done by calling on the King Serpent Ananta, who called in the aid
of another great serpent, V&aacute;suki, the latter being used as a
rope coiling and uncoiling to whirl the mountain. At last the Amrita
appeared. But there also streamed forth from the ocean bed a terrible
stench and venom, which was spreading through the universe when Siva
swallowed it to save mankind,&mdash;the drug having stained his throat
blue, whence his epithet &lsquo;Blue Neck.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the Asuras saw the Amrita, they claimed it; but one of the
Devas, Narya, assumed the form of a beautiful woman, and so fascinated
them that they forgot the Amrita for the moment, which the gods drank.
One of the Asuras, however, R&aacute;hu, assumed the form of a god or
Deva, and began to drink. The immortalising nectar had not gone farther
than his throat when the sun and moon saw the deceit and discovered it
to Naraya, who cut off R&aacute;hu&rsquo;s head. The head of
R&aacute;hu, being immortal, bounded to the sky, where its efforts to
devour the sun and moon, which betrayed him, causes their eclipses. The
tail (Ketu) also enjoys immortality in a lower plane, and is the fatal
planet which sends diseases on mankind. A furious war between the gods
and the Asuras has been waged ever since. And since the Devas are the
strongest, it is not wonderful that it should have passed into the
folklore of the whole Aryan world that the evil host are for ever
seeking to recover by cunning the Amrita. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb68" href="#v2pb68" name=
"v2pb68">68</a>]</span>Serpents guarding the paradise of the Devas have
more than once, in a mythologic sense, been induced to betray their
trust and glide into the divine precincts to steal the coveted draught.
This is the Kv&aacute;sir<a class="noteref" id="xd20e9171src" href=
"#xd20e9171" name="xd20e9171src">2</a> of the Scandinavian Mythology,
which is the source of that poetic inspiration whose songs have magical
potency. The sacramental symbol of the Amrita in Hindu Theology is the
Soma juice, and this plant Indra is declared in the Rig-Veda (i. 130)
to have discovered &ldquo;hidden, like the nestlings of a bird, amidst
a pile of rocks enclosed by bushes,&rdquo; where the dragon Drought had
concealed it. Indra, in the shape of a hawk, flew away with it. In the
Prose Edda the Frost Giant Suttung has concealed the sacred juice, and
it is kept by the maid Gunlauth in a cavern overgrown with bushes.
Bragi bored a hole through the rock. Odin in the shape of a worm crept
through the crevice; then resuming his godlike shape, charmed the maid
into permitting him to drink one draught out of the three jars; and,
having left no drop, in form of an eagle flew to Asgard, and discharged
in the jars the wonder-working liquid. Hence poetry is called
Odin&rsquo;s booty, and Odin&rsquo;s gift.</p>
<p>Those who attentively compare these myths with the legend in Genesis
will not have any need to rest upon the doubtful etymology of
&lsquo;Adam&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e9179src" href=
"#xd20e9179" name="xd20e9179src">3</a> to establish the Ayran
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb69" href="#v2pb69" name=
"v2pb69">69</a>]</span>origin of the latter. The Tree of the knowledge
of Good and Evil which made man &lsquo;as one of us&rsquo; (the Elohim)
is the Soma of India, the Haoma of Persia, the <i>kv&aacute;sir</i> of
Scandinavia, to which are ascribed the intelligence and powers of the
gods, and the ardent thoughts of their worshippers. The Tree of
Immortality is the Amrita, the only monopoly of the gods. &lsquo;The
Lord God said, Behold the man is become as one of us, to know good and
evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of
life, and eat, and live for ever: Therefore the Lord God sent him forth
the garden of Eden to till the ground whence he had been taken. So he
drove out the man; and he placed on the east of the garden of Eden
cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way
of the tree of life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This flaming sword turning every way is independent <span class=

the cherub, and takes the place of the serpent which had previously
guarded the Meru paradise, but is now an enemy no longer to be
trusted.</p>
<p>If the reader will now re-read the story in Genesis with the old
names restored, he will perceive that there is no puzzle at all in any
part of it:&mdash;&lsquo;Now R&aacute;hu [because he had stolen and
tasted Soma] was more subtle than any beast of the field which the
Devas had made, and he said to Adea Suktee, the first woman, Have the
Devas said you shall not eat of every tree in the garden? And she said
unto R&aacute;hu, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden;
but of the Soma-plant, which is in the middle of the garden, the Devas
have said we shall not eat or touch it on pain of death. Then
R&aacute;hu said to Adea, You will not suffer death by tasting Soma [I
have done so, and live]: the Devas know that on the day when you taste
it your eyes shall be opened, and you will be equal to them in
knowledge of good and evil ... [and you will be able at once to
discover which tree it is that bears the fruit which renders you
immortal&mdash;the Amrita].... Adea took of the Soma and did eat, and
gave also unto Adima, her husband, and the eyes of them both were
opened.... And Indra, chief of the Devas, said to R&aacute;hu, Because
you have done this, you are cursed above all cattle and above every
beast of the field; [for they shall transmigrate, their souls ascend
through higher forms to be absorbed in the Creative principle; but]
upon thy belly shalt thou go [remaining transfixed in the form you have
assumed to try and obtain the Amrita]; and [instead of the ambrosia you
aimed at] you shall eat dirt <span class="corr" id="xd20e9232" title=
"Source: though">through</span> all your existence.... And Indra said,
Adima and Adea Suktee have [tasted Soma, and] become as one of us Devas
[so far as] to know good and evil; and now, lest man put forth his hand
[on our precious Amrita], and take also of the tree of life, and eat,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb71" href="#v2pb71" name=
"v2pb71">71</a>]</span>live for ever [giving us another race of Asuras
or Serpent-men to compete with].... Indra and the Devas drove Adima out
of Meru, and placed watch-dogs at the east of the garden; and [a
sinuous darting flame, precisely matched to the now unchangeable form
of R&aacute;hu], a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the
way of the Amrita from Adima and Asuras.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While the gods and serpents were churning the ocean for the Amrita,
all woes and troubles for mortals came up first. That ocean shrinks in
one region to the box of Pandora, in another to the fruit eaten by Eve.
How foreign such a notion is to the Hebrew theology is shown by the
fact that even while the curses are falling from the fatal fruit on the
earth and man, they are all said to have proceeded solely from Jehovah,
who is thus made to supplement the serpent&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>It will be seen that in the above version of the story in Genesis I
have left out various passages. These are in part such as must be more
fully treated in the succeeding chapter, and in part the Semitic mosses
which have grown upon the Aryan boulder. But even after the slight
treatment which is all I have space to devote to the comparative study
of the myth in this aspect, it may be safely affirmed that the problems
which we found insoluble by Hebrew correlatives no longer exist if an
Aryan origin be assumed. We know why the fruit of knowledge was
forbidden: because it endangered the further fruit of immortality. We
know how the Serpent might be condemned to crawl for ever without
absurdity: because he was of a serpent-race, able to assume higher
forms, and capable of transmigration, and of final absorption. We know
why the eating of the fruit brought so many woes: it was followed by
the stream of poison from the churned ocean which accompanied the
Amrita, and which would have destroyed the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb72" href="#v2pb72" name=
"v2pb72">72</a>]</span>race of both gods and men, had not Siva drank it
up. If anything were required to make the Aryan origin of the fable
certain, it will be found in the fact which will appear as we go
on,&mdash;namely, that the rabbins of our era, in explaining the legend
which their fathers severely ignored, did so by borrowing conceptions
foreign to the original ideas of their race,&mdash;notions about human
transformation to animal shapes, and about the Serpent (which Moses
honoured), and mainly of a kind travestying the Iranian folklore. Such
contact with foreign races for the first time gave the Jews any key to
the legend which their patriarchs and prophets were compelled to pass
over in silence. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb73" href="#v2pb73"

Sanskrit <i>Adima</i> means &lsquo;the first;&rsquo; in Hebrew
<i>Adam</i> (given almost always with the article) means &lsquo;the
red,&rsquo; and it is generally derived from <i>adamah</i>, mould or
soil. But Professor Max M&uuml;ller (Science of Religion, p. 320) says
if the name <i>Adima</i> (used, by the way, in India for the first man,
as <i>Adam</i> is in England) is the same as <i>Adam</i>, &lsquo;we
should be driven to admit that Adam was borrowed by the Jews from the
Hindus.&rsquo; But even that mild case of &lsquo;driving&rsquo; is
unnecessary, since the word, as Sale reminded the world, is used in the
Persian legend. It is probable that the Hebrews imported this word not
knowing its meaning, and as it resembled their word for mould, they
added the gloss that the first man was made of the dust or mould of the
ground. It is not contended that the Hebrews got their word directly
from the Hindu or Persian myth. Mr. George Smith discovered that Admi
or Adami was the name for the first men in Chaldean fragments. Sir
Henry Rawlinson points out that the ancient Babylonians recognised two
principle races,&mdash;the Adamu, or dark, and the Sarku, or light,
race; probably a distinction, remembered in the phrase of Genesis,
between the supposed sons of Adam and the sons of God. The dark race
was the one that fell. Mr. Herbert Spencer (<i>Principles of
Sociology</i>, Appendix) offers an ingenious suggestion that the
prohibition of a certain sacred fruit may have been the provision of a
light race against a dark one, as in Peru only the Yuca and his
relatives were allowed to eat the stimulating <i>cuca</i>. If this be
true in the present case, it would still only reflect an earlier
tradition that the holy fruit was the rightful possession of the
deities who had won in the struggle for it.</p>
<p class="footnote">Nor is there wanting a survival from Indian
tradition in the story of Eve. Adam said, &lsquo;This now is bone of my
bone, and flesh of my flesh.&rsquo; In the Manu Code (ix. 22) it is
written: &lsquo;The bone of woman is united with the bone of man, and
her flesh with his flesh.&rsquo; The Indian Adam fell in twain,
becoming male and female (Yama and Yami). Ewald (Hist. of Israel, i. 1)
has put this matter of the relation between Hebrew and Hindu
traditions, as it appears to me, beyond doubt. See also
Goldziher&rsquo;s Heb. Mythol., p. 326; and Professor King&rsquo;s
<i>Gnostics</i>, pp. 9, 10, where the historic conditions under which
the importation would naturally have occurred are succinctly set forth.
Professor King suggests that <i>Pa&#7771;s&icirc;</i> and

<p class="first">The insignificance of the Serpent of Eden in the
scheme and teachings of the Hebrew Bible is the more remarkable when it
is considered that the pessimistic view of human nature is therein
fully represented. In the story of the Temptation itself, there is,
indeed, no such generalisation as we find in the modern dogma of the
Fall of Man; but the elements of it are present in the early assumption
that the thoughts of man&rsquo;s heart run to evil
continually,&mdash;which must be an obvious fact everywhere while
goodness is identified with fictitious merits. There are also
expressions suggesting a theory of heredity, of a highly superstitious
character,&mdash;the inheritance being by force of the ancestral word
or act, and without reference to inherent qualities. Outward merits and
demerits are transmitted for reward and punishment to the third and
fourth generation; but the more common-sense view appears to have
gradually superseded this, as expressed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb74" href="#v2pb74" name="v2pb74">74</a>]</span>in the proverb that
the fathers ate sour grapes and the children&rsquo;s teeth were on
edge.</p>
<p>In accounting for this condition of human nature, popular traditions
among the Jews always pointed rather to a fall of the gods than to any
such catastrophe to man. &lsquo;The sons of the Elohim (gods) saw the
daughters of men that they were beautiful, and they took to themselves
for wives whomsoever they chose.&rsquo; &lsquo;There were giants in the
earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in
unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same
became mighty men, which were of old men of renown.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e9259src" href="#xd20e9259" name="xd20e9259src">1</a>
These giants were to the Semitic mind what the Ahis, Vritras, Sushnas
and other monsters were to the Aryan, or Titans to the Greek mind. They
were not traced to the Serpent, but to the wild nature-gods, the
Elohim, and when Jehovah appears it is to wage war against them. The
strength of this belief is illustrated in the ample accounts given in
the Old Testament of the Rephaim and their king Og, the Anakim and
Goliath, the Emim, the Zamzummim, and others, all of which gained full
representation in Hebrew folklore. The existence of these hostile
beings was explained by their fall from angelic estate.</p>
<p>The Book of Enoch gives what was no doubt the popular understanding
of the fall of the angels and its results. Two hundred angels took
wives of the daughters of men, and their offspring were giants three
thousand yards in height. These giants having consumed the food of
mankind, began to devour men, whose cries were brought to the attention
of Jehovah by his angels. One angel was sent to warn Noah of the Flood;
another to bind Azazel in a dark place in the desert till the Judgment
Day; Gabriel was despatched to set the giants to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb75" href="#v2pb75" name=
"v2pb75">75</a>]</span>destroying one another; Michael was sent to bury
the fallen angels under the hills for seventy generations, till the Day
of Judgment, when they should be sent to the fiery abyss for ever. Then
every evil work should come to an end, and the plant of righteousness
spring up.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e9268src" href="#xd20e9268" name=
"xd20e9268src">2</a></p>
<p>Such exploits and successes on the part of the legal Deity against
outlaws, though they may be pitched high in heroic romance, are found
beside a theology based upon a reverse situation. Nothing is more
fundamental in the ancient Jewish system than the recognition of an
outside world given over to idolatry and wickedness, while Jews are a
small colony of the children of Israel and chosen of Jehovah. Such a
conception in primitive times is so natural, and possibly may have been
so essential to the constitution of nations, that it is hardly useful
to look for parallels. Though nearly all races see in their traditional
dawn an Age of Gold, a Happy Garden, or some corresponding felicity,
these are normally defined against anterior chaos or surrounding
ferocity. Every Eden has had its guards.</p>
<p>When we come to legends which relate particularly to the way in
which the early felicity was lost, many facts offer themselves for
comparative study. And with regard to the myths of Eden and Eve, we may
remark what appears to have been a curious interchange of legends
between the Hebrews and Persians. The ancient doctrines of India and
Persia concerning Origins are largely, if not altogether, astronomical.
In the Genesis of India we see a golden egg floating on a shoreless
ocean; it divides to make the heaven above and earth beneath; from it
emerges Praj&aacute;pati, who also falls in twain to make the mortal
and immortal substances; the parts of him again divide to make men and
women on earth, sun and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb76" href=
"#v2pb76" name="v2pb76">76</a>]</span>moon in the sky. This is but one
version out of many, but all the legends about Praj&aacute;pati
converge in making him a figure of Indian astronomy. In the Rig-Veda he
is Orion, and for ever lies with the three arrows in his belt which
Sirius shot at him because of his love for Aldebaran,&mdash;towards
which constellation he stretches. Now, in a sort of antithesis to this,
the evil R&aacute;hu is also cut in twain, his upper and immortal part
pursuing and trying to eclipse the sun and moon, his tail (Ketu)
becoming the 9th planet, shedding evil influences on mankind.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e9277src" href="#xd20e9277" name="xd20e9277src">3</a>
This tail, Ketu, is quite an independent monster, and we meet with him
in the Persian planisphere, where he rules the first of the six
mansions of Ahriman, and is the &lsquo;crooked serpent&rsquo; mentioned
in the Book of Job. By referring to <a href="#v1pb253">vol. i. p.
253</a>, the reader will see that this Star-serpent must stand as close
to the woman with her child and sheaf as September stands to October.
But unquestionably the woman was put there for honour and not disgrace;
with her child and sheaf she represented the fruitage of the year.</p>
<p>There is nothing in Persian Mythology going to show that the woman
betrayed her mansion of fruitage&mdash;the golden year&mdash;to the
Serpent near her feet. In the Bundehesch we have the original man,
Kaiomarts, who is slain by Ahriman as Praj&aacute;pati (Orion) was by
Sirius; from his dead form came Meschia and Meschiane, the first human
pair. Ahriman corrupts them by first giving them goats&rsquo; milk, an
evil influence from Capricorn. After they had thus injured themselves
he tempted them with a fruit which robbed them of ninety-nine
hundredths of their happiness. In all this there is no indication that
the woman and man bore different relations to the calamity. But after a
time we find a Pars&icirc; postscript to this effect: &lsquo;The woman
was the first to sacrifice to the Devas.&rsquo; This <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb77" href="#v2pb77" name="v2pb77">77</a>]</span>is
the one item in the Pars&icirc; Mythology which shows bias against
woman, and as it is unsupported by the narratives preceding it, we may
suppose that it was derived from some foreign country.</p>
<p>That country could hardly have been India. There is a story in
remote districts of India which relates that the first woman was born
out of an expanding lotus on the Ganges, and was there received in his
paradise by the first man (Adima, or Manu). Having partaken of the
Soma, they were expelled, after first being granted their prayer to be
allowed a last draught from the Ganges; the effect of the holy water
being to prevent entire corruption, and secure immortality to their
souls. But nowhere in Indian legend or folklore do we find any special
dishonour put upon woman such as is described in the Hebrew story.</p>
<p>Rather we find the reverse. Early in the last century, a traveller,
John Marshall, related stories of the creation which he says were told
him by the Brahmins, and others &lsquo;by the Brahmins of
Persia.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e9294src" href="#xd20e9294"
name="xd20e9294src">4</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Once on a time,&rsquo; the Brahmins said, &lsquo;as (God) was
set in eternity, it came into his mind to make something, and
immediately no sooner had he thought the same, but that the same minute
was a perfect beautiful woman present immediately before him, which he
called Adea Suktee, that is, the first woman. Then this figure put into
his mind the figure of a man; which he had no sooner conceived in his
mind, but that he also started up, and represented himself before him;
this he called Manapuise, that is, the first man; then, upon a
reflection of these things, he resolved further to create several
places for them to abide in, and accordingly, assuming a subtil body,
he breathed in a minute the whole universe, and everything therein,
from the least to the greatest.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb78" href="#v2pb78" name="v2pb78">78</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;The Brahmins of Persia tell certain long stories of a great
Giant that was led into a most delicate garden, which, upon certain
conditions, should be his own for ever. But one evening in a cool shade
one of the wicked Devatas, or spirits, came to him, and tempted him
with vast sums of gold, and all the most precious jewels that can be
imagined; but he courageously withstood that temptation, as not knowing
what value or use they were of: but at length this wicked Devata
brought to him a fair woman, who so charmed him that for her sake he
most willingly broke all his conditions, and thereupon was turned
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the first of these two stories the names given to the man and
woman are popular words derived from Sanskrit. In the second the
Persian characters are present, as in the use of Devatas to denote
wicked powers; but for the rest, this latter legend appears to me
certainly borrowed from the Jews so far as the woman is concerned. It
was they who first perceived any connection between Virgo in the sixth
mansion of Ormuzd, and Python in the seventh, and returned the Persians
their planisphere with a new gloss. Having adopted the Dragon&rsquo;s
tail (Ketu) for a little preliminary performance, the Hebrew system
dismisses that star-snake utterly; for it has already evolved a
terrestrial devil from its own inner consciousness.</p>
<p>The name of that devil is&mdash;<span class="sc">Woman</span>. The
diabolisation of woman in their theology and tradition is not to be
regarded as any indication that the Hebrews anciently held women in
dishonour; rather was it a tribute to her powers of fascination such as
the young man wrote to be placed under the pillow of
Darius&mdash;&lsquo;Woman is strongest.&rsquo; As Darius and his
council agreed that, next to truth, woman is strongest&mdash;stronger
than wine or than kings, so do the Hebrew fables testify by
interweaving her beauty and genius with every evil of the world.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb79" href="#v2pb79" name=
"v2pb79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p>Between the Elohist and Jahvist accounts of the creation of man,
there are two differences of great importance. The Elohim are said to
have <i>created</i> man in their own image, male and female,&mdash;the
word for &lsquo;created&rsquo; being <i>bar&aacute;</i>, literally
meaning to <i>carve</i> out. Jehovah Elohim is said to have
<i>formed</i> man,&mdash;nothing being said about his own image, or
about male and female,&mdash;the word <i>formed</i> being
<i>yatsar&rsquo;</i>. The sense of this word <i>yatsar</i> in this
place (Gen. ii. 7) must be interpreted by what follows: Jehovah is said
to have formed man out of the <i>aphar&rsquo;</i>, which the English
version translates dust, but the Septuagint more correctly
<i>sperma</i>. The literal meaning is a finely volatilised substance,
and in Numbers xxiii. 10, it is used to represent the seed of Jacob. In
the Jehovistic creation it means that man was formed out of the seminal
principle of the earth combined with the breath of Jehovah; and the
legend closely resembles the account of the ancient
Satapatha-Br&aacute;hmana, which shows the creative power in sexual
union with the fluid world to produce the egg from which
Praj&aacute;pati was born, to be divided into man and woman.</p>
<p>These two accounts, therefore,&mdash;to wit, that in the first and
that in the second chapter of Genesis,&mdash;must be regarded as being
of different events, and not merely varying myths of the same event.
The offspring of Jehovah were &lsquo;living souls,&rsquo; an expression
not used in connection with the created images of the giants or Elohim.
The Elohist pair roam about the world freely eating all fruits and
herbs, possessing nature generally, and, as male and female, encouraged
to increase and multiply; but Jehovah carefully separates <i>his</i>
two children from general nature, places them in a garden, forbids
certain food, and does not say a word about sex even, much less
encourage its functions. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb80" href=
"#v2pb80" name="v2pb80">80</a>]</span></p>
<p>Adam was formed simply to be the gardener of Eden; no other motive
is assigned. In proposing the creation of a being to be his helper and
companion, nothing is said about a new sex,&mdash;the word translated
&lsquo;help-meet&rsquo; (<i>&eacute;zer</i>) is masculine. Adam names
the being made &lsquo;woman,&rsquo; (Vulg. <i>Virago</i>) only because
she has been made out of man, but sex is not even yet suggested. This
is so marked that the compiler has filled up what he considered an
omission with (verse 24) a little lecture on duty to wives.</p>
<p>It is plain that the jealously-guarded ambrosia of Aryan gods has
here been adapted to signify the sexual relation. That is the fruit in
the midst of the garden which is reserved. The eating of it is
immediately associated with consciousness of nudity and shame. The
curse upon Eve is appropriate. Having taken a human husband, she is to
be his slave; she shall bring forth children in sorrow, and many of
them (Gen. iii. 16). Adam is to lose his position in Jehovah&rsquo;s
garden, and to toil in accursed ground, barren and thorny.</p>
<p>Cast out thus into the wilderness, the human progeny as it increased
came in contact with the giant&rsquo;s progeny,&mdash;those created by
the Elohim (Gen. i.). When these had intermarried, Jehovah said that
the fact that the human side in such alliance had been originally
vitalised by his breath could not now render it immortal, because
&lsquo;he (man) also is flesh,&rsquo; <i>i.e.</i>, like the creatures
of the nature-gods. After two great struggles with these Titans,
drowning most of them, hurling down their tower and scattering them,
Jehovah resolved upon a scheme of vast importance, and one which casts
a flood of light upon the narrative just given. Jehovah&rsquo;s great
aim is shown in the Abrahamic covenant to be to found a family on
earth, of which he can say, &lsquo;Thou art my son; I have begotten
thee.&rsquo; Eve <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb81" href="#v2pb81"
name="v2pb81">81</a>]</span>was meant to be the mother of that family,
but by yielding to her passion for the man meant only to be her
companion she had thwarted the purpose of Jehovah. But she reappears
again under the name of Sara; and from first to last the sense of these
records, however overlaid by later beliefs, is the expansion, varying
fortunes, and gradual spiritualisation of this aspiration of a deity
for a family of his own in the earth.</p>
<p>Celsus said that the story of the Virgin Mary and the Holy Ghost is
one in which Christians would find little &lsquo;mystery&rsquo; if the
names were Dana&euml; and Jupiter. The same may be said of the story of
Sara and Jehovah, of which that concerning Mary is a theological
travesty. Sarai (as she was called before her transfer to Jehovah, who
then forbade Abraham to call her &lsquo;<i>My</i> Princess,&rsquo; but
only &lsquo;Princess&rsquo;) was chosen because she was childless.
Abraham was paid a large recompense for her surrender, and provision
was made that he should have a mistress, and by her a son. This natural
son was to be renowned and have great possessions; nominally Abraham
was to be represented by Sara&rsquo;s miraculously-conceived son, and
to control his fortunes, but the blood of the new race was to be purely
divine in its origin, so that every descendant of Isaac might be of
Jehovah&rsquo;s family in Abraham&rsquo;s household.</p>
<p>Abraham twice gave over his wife to different kings who were
jealously punished by Jehovah for sins they only came near committing
unconsciously, while Abraham himself was not even rebuked for the sin
he did commit. The forbidden fruit was not eaten this time; and the
certificate and proof of the supernatural conception of Isaac were made
clear in Sarah&rsquo;s words&mdash;&lsquo;God hath made me to laugh:
all that hear will laugh with me: who would have said unto Abraham that
Sarah should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb82" href="#v2pb82" name=
"v2pb82">82</a>]</span>have given children suck? for I have borne a son
in his old age.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e9382src" href=
"#xd20e9382" name="xd20e9382src">5</a></p>
<p>It was the passionate nature and beauty of Woman which had thus far
made the difficulty. The forbidden fruit was &lsquo;pleasant to the
eyes,&rsquo; and Eve ate it; and it was her &lsquo;voice&rsquo; to
which Adam had hearkened rather than to that of Jehovah (Gen. iii. 17).
And, again, it was the easy virtue and extreme beauty of Sara (Gen.
xii. 11, 14) which endangered the new scheme. The rabbinical traditions
are again on this point very emphatic. It is related that when Abram
came to the border of Egypt he hid Sara in a chest, and was so taking
her into that country. The collector of customs charged that the chest
contained raiment, silks, gold, pearls, and Abram paid for all these;
but this only increased the official&rsquo;s suspicions, and he
compelled Abram to open the chest; when this was done and Sara rose up,
the whole land of Egypt was illumined by her splendour.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e9396src" href="#xd20e9396" name=
"xd20e9396src">6</a></p>
<p>There is no reason for supposing that the ideas underlying the
relation which Jehovah meant to establish with Eve, and succeeded in
establishing with Sara, were of a merely sensual description. These
myths belong to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb83" href=
"#v2pb83" name="v2pb83">83</a>]</span>mental region of
ancestor-worship, and the fundamental conception is that of founding a
family to reign over all other families. Jehovah&rsquo;s interest is in
Isaac rather than Sara, who, after she has borne that patriarch, lapses
out of the story almost as completely as Eve. The idea is not, indeed,
so theological as it became in the Judaic-christian legend of the
conception of Jesus by Mary as spouse of the Deity; it was probably,
however, largely ethnical in the case of Eve, and national in that of
Sara.</p>
<p>It being considered of the utmost importance that all who claimed
the advantages in the Jewish commonwealth accruing only to the legal,
though nominal, &lsquo;children of Abraham,&rsquo; should really be of
divine lineage, security must be had against Isaac having any full
brother. It might be that in after time some natural son of Sara might
claim to be the one born of divine parentage, might carry on the Jewish
commonwealth, slay the children of Jehovah by Sara, and so end the
divine lineage with the authority it carried. Careful precautions
having been taken that Ishmael should be an
&lsquo;irreconcilable,&rsquo; there is reason to suspect that the
position of Isaac as Jehovah&rsquo;s &lsquo;only-begotten son&rsquo;
was secured by means obscurely hinted in the circumcision first
undergone by Abraham, and made the sign of the covenant. That
circumcision, wheresoever it has survived, is the relic of a more
horrible practice of barbarian asceticism, is hardly doubtful; that the
original rite was believed to have been that by which Abraham fulfilled
his contract with Jehovah, appears to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb84" href="#v2pb84" name="v2pb84">84</a>]</span>me intimated in
various passages of the narrative which have survived editorial
arrangement in accordance with another view. For instance, the vast
inducements offered Abraham, and the great horror that fell on the
patriarch, appear hardly explicable on the theory that nothing was
conceded on Abraham&rsquo;s side beyond the surrender of a wife whom he
had freely consigned to earthly monarchs.</p>
<p>Though the suspicion just expressed as to the nature of
Abraham&rsquo;s circumcision may be doubted, it is not questionable
that the rite of circumcision bears a significance in rabbinical
traditions and Jewish usages which renders its initiation by Abraham at
least a symbol of marital renunciation. Thus, the custom of placing in
a room where the rite of circumcision was performed a pot of dust, was
explained by the rabbins to have reference to the dust which Jehovah
declared should be the serpent&rsquo;s food.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e9411src" href="#xd20e9411" name="xd20e9411src">7</a> That
circumcision should have been traditionally associated with the
temptation of Eve is a confirmation of the interpretation which regards
her (Eve) as the prototype of Sara and the serpent as sexual
desire.</p>
<p>Although, if the original sense of Abraham&rsquo;s circumcision were
what has been suggested, it had been overlaid, when the Book of Genesis
in its present form was compiled, by different traditions, and that
patriarch is described as having married again and had other children,
the superior sanctity of Sara&rsquo;s son was preserved. Indeed, there
would seem to have continued for a long time a tradition that the
Abrahamic line and covenant were to be carried out by &lsquo;the seed
of the woman&rsquo; alone, and the paternity of Jehovah. Like Sara,
Rebekah is sterile, and after her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb85"
href="#v2pb85" name="v2pb85">85</a>]</span>Rachel; the birth of Jacob
and Esau from one, and of Joseph and Benjamin from the other, being
through the intervention of Jehovah.</p>
<p>The great power of woman for good or evil, and the fact that it has
often been exercised with subtlety&mdash;the natural weapon of the weak
in dealing with the strong&mdash;are remarkably illustrated in the
legends of these female figures which appear in connection with the
divine schemes in the Book of Genesis. But even more the perils of
woman&rsquo;s beauty are illustrated, especially in Eve and Sara. There
were particular and obvious reasons why these representative women
could not be degraded or diabolised in their own names or history, even
where their fascinations tended to countervail the plans of Jehovah.
The readiness with which Sara promoted her husband&rsquo;s prostitution
and consented to her own, the treachery of Rebekah to her son Esau,
could yet not induce Jewish orthodoxy to give evil names to the
Madonnas of their race; but the inference made was expressed under
other forms and names. It became a settled superstition that wherever
evil was going on, Woman was at the bottom of it. Potiphar&rsquo;s
wife, Jezebel, Vashti, and Delilah, were among the many she-scape-goats
on whom were laid the offences of their august official predecessors
who &lsquo;could do no wrong.&rsquo; Even after Satan has come upon the
scene, and is engaged in tempting Job, it seems to have been thought
essential to the task that he should have an agent beside the troubled
man in the wife who bade him &lsquo;curse God and die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is impossible to say at just what period the rabbins made their
ingenious discovery that the devil and Woman entered the world at the
same time,&mdash;he coming out of the hole left by removal of the rib
from Adam before it was closed. This they found disclosed in the fact
that it is in Genesis iii. 21, describing the creation of Woman, that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb86" href="#v2pb86" name=
"v2pb86">86</a>]</span>there appears for the first time
<i>Samech</i>&mdash;the serpent-letter S (in <i>Vajisgor</i>).<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e9435src" href="#xd20e9435" name="xd20e9435src">8</a>
But there were among them many legends of a similar kind that leave one
no wonder concerning the existence of a thanksgiving taught boys that
they have not been created women, however much one may be scandalised
at its continuance in the present day. It was only in pursuance of this
theory of Woman that there was developed at a later day a female
assistant of the Devil in another design to foil the plans of Jehovah,
from the Scriptual narrative of which the female r&ocirc;le is omitted.
In the Scriptural legend of Noah his wife is barely mentioned, and her
name is not given, but from an early period vague rumours to her
discredit floated about, and these gathered consistency in the Gnostic
legend that it was through her that Satan managed to get on board the
Ark, as is elsewhere related (<a href="#v2ch27">Part IV. chap.
xxvii</a>.), and was so enabled to resuscitate antediluvial violence in
the drunken curses of Noah. Satan did this by working upon both the
curiosity and jealousy of Noraita, the name assigned Noah&rsquo;s
wife.</p>
<p>It has been necessary to give at length the comparative view of the
myth of Eden in order that the reader may estimate the grounds upon
which rests a theory which has been submitted after much hesitation
concerning its sense. The &lsquo;phallic&rsquo; theory by which it has
become the fashion to interpret so many of these old fables, appears to
me to have been done to death; yet I cannot come to any other
conclusion concerning the legend of Eve than that she represents that
passional nature of Woman which, before it was brought under such rigid
restraint, might easily be regarded as a weakness to any tribe desirous
of keeping itself separate from other tribes. The oath exacted by
Abraham <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb87" href="#v2pb87" name=
"v2pb87">87</a>]</span>of his servant that he should seek out a wife
from among his own people, and not among Canaanitish women, is one
example among many of this feeling, which, indeed, survives among Jews
at the present day. Such a sentiment might underlie the stories of Eve
and Sara&mdash;the one mingling the blood of the family of Jehovah with
mere human flesh, the other nearly confusing it with aliens. As the
idea of tribal sanctity and separateness became strengthened by the
further development of theocratic government, such myths would take on
forms representing Jehovah&rsquo;s jealousy in defending his family
line against the evil powers which sought to confuse or destroy it. One
such attempt appears to underlie the story of the proposed sacrifice of
Isaac. Although the account we have of that proceeding in the Bible was
written at a time when the Elohist and Jahvist parties had compromised
their rivalries to some extent, and suggests the idea that Jehovah
himself ordered the sacrifice in order to try the faith of Abraham,
enough of the primitive tradition lingers in the narrative to make it
probable that its original intent was to relate how one of the
superseded Elohim endeavoured to tempt Abraham to sacrifice
Sara&rsquo;s only son, and so subvert the aim of Jehovah to perpetuate
his seed. The God who &lsquo;tempted Abraham&rsquo; is throughout
sharply distinguished from the Jehovah who sent his angel to prevent
the sacrifice and substitute an animal victim for Isaac.</p>
<p>Although, as we have seen, Sara was spared degradation into a
she-devil in subsequent myths, because her body was preserved intact
despite her laxity of mind, such was not the case with Eve. The silence
concerning her preserved throughout the Bible after her fall is told
was broken by the ancient rabbins, and there arose multitudinous
legends in which her intimacies with devils are circumstantially
reported. Her first child, Cain, was generally <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb88" href="#v2pb88" name=
"v2pb88">88</a>]</span>believed to be the son of one of the devils
(Sama&euml;l) that consorted with her, and the world was said to be
peopled with gnomes and demons which she brought forth during that 130
years at the end of which it is stated that Adam begot a son in his own
image and likeness, and called his name Seth (Gen. v. 3). The previous
children were supposed to be not in purely human form, and not to have
been of Adam&rsquo;s paternity. Adam had during that time refused to
have any children, knowing that he would only rear inmates of hell.</p>
<p>The legend of Eden has gone round the world doing various duty, but
nearly always associated with the introduction of moral evil into the
world. In the Lateran Museum at Rome there is a remarkable bas-relief
representing a nude man and woman offering sacrifice before a serpent
coiled around a tree, while an angel overthrows the altar with his
foot. This was probably designed as a fling at the Ophites, and is very
interesting as a survival from the ancient Aryan meaning of the
Serpent. But since the adaptation of the myth by the Semitic race, it
has generally emphasised the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil,
instead of the Tree of Immortality (Amrita), which is the chief point
of interest in the Aryan myth. There are indeed traces of a conflict
with knowledge and scepticism in it which we shall have to consider
hereafter. The main popular association with it, the introduction into
the world of all the ills that flesh is heir to, is perfectly
consistent with the sense which has been attributed to its early Hebrew
form; for this includes the longing for maternity, its temptations and
its pains, and the sorrows and sins which are obviously traceable to
it.</p>
<p>Some years ago, when the spectacular drama of &lsquo;Paradise&rsquo;
was performed in Paris, the Temptation was effected by means of a
mirror. Satan glided behind the tree as a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb89" href="#v2pb89" name="v2pb89">89</a>]</span>serpent, and then
came forth as a handsome man, and after uttering compliments that she
could not understand, presented Eve with a small oval mirror which
explained them all. Mlle. Abingdon as Eve displayed consummate art in
her expression of awakening self-admiration, of the longing for
admiration from the man before her, and the various stages of
self-consciousness by which she is brought under the Tempter&rsquo;s
power. This idea of the mirror was no doubt borrowed from the
corresponding fable of Pandora. On a vase (Etruscan) in the Hamilton
Collection there is an admirable representation of Pandora opening her
box, from which all evils are escaping. She is seated beneath a tree,
around which a serpent is coiled. Among the things which have come out
of the box is this same small oval mirror. In this variant, Hope,
coming out last corresponds with the prophecy that the seed of the
woman shall bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head. The ancient Etruscan and
the modern Parisian version are both by the mirror finely connected
with the sexual sense of the legend.</p>
<p>The theological interpretation of the beautiful myth of Eden
represents a sort of spiritual vivisection; yet even as a dogma the
story preserves high testimony: when woman falls the human race falls
with her; when man rises above his inward or outward degradations and
recovers his Paradise, it is because his nature is refined by the
purity of woman, and his home sweetened by her heart. There is a
widespread superstition that every Serpent will single out a woman from
any number of people for its attack. In such dim way is felt her gentle
bruising of man&rsquo;s reptilian self. No wonder that woman is
excluded from those regions of life where man&rsquo;s policy is still
to crawl, eat dust, and bite the heel.</p>
<p>It is, I suppose, the old Mystery of the Creation which left
Coventry its legend of a Good Eve (Godiva<span class="corr" id=
"xd20e9466" title="Not in source">, whose name is written &lsquo;good
Eve&rsquo; in a Conventry verse, 1494</span>), whose <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb90" href="#v2pb90" name=
"v2pb90">90</a>]</span>nakedness should bring benefit to man, as that
of the first Eve brought him evil. The fig-leaf of Eve, gathered no
doubt from the tree whose forbidden fruit she had eaten, has gradually
grown so large as to cloak her mind and spirit as well as her form. Her
work must still be chiefly that of a spirit veiled and ashamed. Her
passions suppressed, her genius disbelieved, her influence forced to
seek hidden and often illegitimate channels, Woman now outwardly
represents a creation of man to suit his own convenience. But the
Serpent has also changed a great deal since the days of Eve, and now,
as Intelligence, has found out man in his fool&rsquo;s-paradise, where
he stolidly maintains that, with few exceptions, it <i>is</i> good for
man to be alone. But good women are remembering Godiva; and realising
that, the charms which have sometimes lowered man or cost him dear may
be made his salvation. It shall be so when Woman can face with
clear-eyed purity all the facts of nature, can cast away the mental and
moral swathing-clothes transmitted from Eden, and put forth all her
powers for the welfare of mankind,&mdash;a Good Eva, whom Coventry Toms
may call naked, but who is &lsquo;not ashamed&rsquo; of the garb of
Innocence and Truth. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb91" href=

some reason for supposing that Sara is a semiticised form of
Sarany&uacute;. The two stand in somewhat the same typical position.
Sarany&uacute;, daughter of Tvashtar (&lsquo;the fashioner&rsquo;), was
mother of the first human pair, Yama and Yami. Sara is the first mother
of those born in a new (covenanted) creation. Each is for a time
concealed from mortals; each leaves her husband an illegitimate
representative. Sarany&uacute; gives her lord Savarn&aacute;
(&lsquo;substitute&rsquo;), who by him brings forth Manu,&mdash;that is
&lsquo;Man,&rsquo; but not the original perfect Man. Sara substitutes
Hagar (&lsquo;the fleeting&rsquo;), and Ishmael is born, but not within

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The attempt of the compilers of the Book of Genesis to
amalgamate the Elohist and Jehovist legends, ignoring the moral abyss
that yawns between them, led to some sufficiently curious results. One
of these it may be well enough to examine here, since, though later in
form than some other legends which remain to be considered, it is
closely connected in spirit with the ancient myth of Eden and
illustrative of it.</p>
<p>The differences between the two creations of man and woman
critically examined in the previous chapter were fully recognised by
the ancient rabbins, and their speculations on the subject laid the
basis for the further legend that the woman created (Gen. i.) at the
same time with Adam, and therefore not possibly the woman formed from
his rib, was a first wife who turned out badly.</p>
<p>To this first wife of Adam it was but natural to assign the name of
one of the many ancient goddesses who had been degraded into
demonesses. For the history of Mariolatry in the North of Europe has
been many times anticipated: the mother&rsquo;s tenderness and
self-devotion, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb92" href="#v2pb92"
name="v2pb92">92</a>]</span>the first smile of love upon social chaos,
availed to give every race its Madonna, whose popularity drew around
her the fatal favours of priestcraft, weighing her down at last to be a
type of corruption. Even the Semitic tribes, with their hard masculine
deities, seem to have once worshipped Alilat, whose name survives in
Elohim and Allah. Among these degraded Madonnas was Lilith, whose name
has been found in a Chaldean inscription, which says, when a country is
at peace &lsquo;Lilith (Lilatu) is not before them.&rsquo; The name is
from Assyr. <i>lay&rsquo;l&acirc;</i>, Hebrew <i>Lil</i> (night), which
already in Accadian meant &lsquo;sorcery.&rsquo; It probably
personified, at first, the darkness that soothed children to slumber;
and though the word <i>Lullaby</i> has, with more ingenuity than
accuracy, been derived from <i>Lilith Abi</i>, the theory may suggest
the path by which the soft Southern night came to mean a nocturnal
spectre.</p>
<p>The only place where the name of Lilith occurs in the Bible is Isa.
xxxiv. 14, where the English version renders it
&lsquo;screech-owl.&rsquo; In the Vulgate it is translated
&lsquo;Lamia,&rsquo; and in Luther&rsquo;s Bible, &lsquo;Kobold;&rsquo;
Gesenius explains it as &lsquo;nocturna, night-spectre,
ghost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The rabbinical myths concerning Lilith, often passed over as puerile
fancies, appear to me pregnant with significance and beauty. Thus
Abraham Ecchelensis, giving a poor Arabic version of the legend, says,
&lsquo;This fable has been transmitted to the Arabs from Jewish sources
by some converts of Mahomet from Cabbalism and Rabbinism, who have
transferred all the Jewish fooleries to the Arabs.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e9514src" href="#xd20e9514" name="xd20e9514src">1</a>
But the rabbinical legend grew very slowly, and relates to principles
and facts of social evolution whose force and meaning are not yet
exhausted.</p>
<p>Premising that the legend is here pieced together mainly from
Eisenmenger,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e9519src" href="#xd20e9519"
name="xd20e9519src">2</a> who at each mention of the subject
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb93" href="#v2pb93" name=
"v2pb93">93</a>]</span>gives ample references to rabbinical
authorities, I will relate it without further references of my own.</p>
<p>Lilith was said to have been created at the same time and in the
same way as Adam; and when the two met they instantly quarrelled about
the headship which both claimed. Adam began the first conversation by
asserting that he was to be her master. Lilith replied that she had
equal right to be chief. Adam insisting, Lilith uttered a certain spell
called <i>Schem-hammphorasch</i>&mdash;afterwards confided by a fallen
angel to one of &lsquo;the daughters of men&rsquo; with whom he had an
intrigue, and of famous potency in Jewish folklore&mdash;the result of
which was that she obtained wings. Lilith then flew out of Eden and out
of sight.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e9529src" href="#xd20e9529" name=
"xd20e9529src">3</a> Adam then cried in distress&mdash;&lsquo;Master of
the world, the woman whom thou didst give me has flown away.&rsquo; The
Creator then sent three angels to find Lilith and persuade her to
return to the garden; but she declared that it could be no paradise to
her if she was to be the servant of man. She remained hovering over the
Red Sea, where the angels had found her, while these returned with her
inflexible resolution. And she would not yield even after the angels
had been sent again to convey to her, as the alternative of not
returning, the doom that she should bear many children but these should
all die in infancy.</p>
<p>This penalty was so awful that Lilith was about to commit suicide by
drowning herself in the sea, when the three angels, moved by her
anguish, agreed that she should have the compensation of possessing
full power over all children after birth up to their eighth day; on
which she promised that she would never disturb any babes who were
under their (the angels&rsquo;) protection. Hence the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb94" href="#v2pb94" name=
"v2pb94">94</a>]</span>charm (Camea) against Lilith hung round the
necks of Jewish children bore the names of these three
angels&mdash;Sen&oacute;i, Sansen&oacute;i, and Sammangel&oacute;f.
Lilith has special power over all children born out of wedlock for whom
she watches, dressed in finest raiment; and she has especial power on
the first day of the month, and on the Sabbath evening. When a little
child laughs in its sleep it was believed that Lilith was with it, and
the babe must be struck on the nose three times, the words being thrice
repeated&mdash;&lsquo;Away, cursed Lilith! thou hast no place
here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The divorce between Lilith and Adam being complete, the second Eve
(<i>i.e.</i>, Mother) was now formed, and this time out of Adam&rsquo;s
rib in order that there might be no question of her dependence, and
that the embarrassing question of woman&rsquo;s rights might never be
raised again.</p>
<p>But about this time the Devils were also created. These beings were
the last of the six days&rsquo; creation, but they were made so late in
the day that there was no daylight by which to fashion bodies for them.
The Creator was just putting them off with a promise that he would make
them bodies next day, when lo! the Sabbath&mdash;which was for a long
time personified&mdash;came and sat before him, to represent the many
evils which might result from the precedent he would set by working
even a little on the day whose sanctity had already been promulgated.
Under these circumstances the Creator told the Devils that they must
disperse and try to get bodies as they could find them. On this account
they have been compelled ever since to seek carnal enjoyments by
nestling in the hearts of human beings and availing themselves of human
senses and passions.</p>
<p>These Devils as created were ethereal spirits; they had certain
atmospheric forms, but felt that they had been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb95" href="#v2pb95" name=
"v2pb95">95</a>]</span>badly treated in not having been provided with
flesh and blood, and they were envious of the carnal pleasures which
human beings could enjoy. So long as man and woman remained pure, the
Devils could not take possession of their bodies and enjoy such
pleasures, and it was therefore of great importance to them that the
first human pair should be corrupted. At the head of these Devils stood
now a fallen angel&mdash;Sama&euml;l. Of this archfiend more is said
elsewhere; at this point it need only be said that he had been an ideal
flaming Serpent, leader of the Seraphim. He was already burning with
lust and envy, as he witnessed the pleasures of Adam and Eve in Eden,
when he found beautiful Lilith lamenting her wrongs in loneliness.</p>
<p>She became his wife. The name of Sama&euml;l by one interpretation
signifies &lsquo;the Left&rsquo;; and we may suppose that Lilith found
him radical on the question of female equality which she had raised in
Eden. He gave her a splendid kingdom where she was attended by 480
troops; but all this could not compensate her for the loss of
Eden,&mdash;she seems never to have regretted parting with
Adam,&mdash;and for the loss of her children. She remained the Lady of
Sorrow. Her great enemy was Machalath who presided over 478 troops, and
who was for ever dancing, as Lilith was for ever sighing and weeping.
It was long believed that at certain times the voice of Lilith&rsquo;s
grief could be heard in the air.</p>
<p>Sama&euml;l found in Lilith a willing conspirator against Jehovah in
his plans for man and woman. The corruption of these two meant, to the
troops of Sama&euml;l, bringing their bodies down into a plane where
they might be entered by themselves (the Devils), not to mention at
present the manifold other motives by which they were actuated. It may
be remarked also that in the rabbinical <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb96" href="#v2pb96" name="v2pb96">96</a>]</span>traditions, after
their Aryan impregnation, there are traces of a desire of the Devils to
reach the Tree of Life.</p>
<p>Truly a wondrous Tree! Around it, in its place at the east of Eden,
sang six hundred thousand lovely angels with happy hymns, and it
glorified the vast garden. It possessed five hundred thousand different
flavours and odours, which were wafted to the four sides of the world
by zephyrs from seven lustrous clouds that made its canopy. Beneath it
sat the disciples of Wisdom on resplendent seats, screened from the
blaze of sun, moon, and cloud-veiled from potency of the stars (there
was no night); and within were the joys referred to in the verse (Prov.
viii. 21), &lsquo;That I may cause those that love me to inherit
substance; and I will fill their treasures.&rsquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Had there been an order of female rabbins the story of Lilith might
have borne obvious modifications, and she might have appeared as a
heroine anxious to rescue her sex from slavery to man. As it is the
immemorial prerogative of man to lay all blame upon woman, that being
part of the hereditary following of Adam, it is not wonderful that
Lilith was in due time made responsible for the temptation of Eve. She
was supposed to have beguiled the Serpent on guard at the gate of Eden
to lend her his form for a time, after which theory the curse on the
serpent might mean the binding of Lilith for ever in that form. This
would appear to have originated the notion mentioned in Comestor (Hist.
Schol., 12th cent.), that while the serpent was yet erect it had a
virgin&rsquo;s head. The accompanying example is from a very early
missal in the possession of Sir Joseph Hooker, of which I could not
discover the date or history, but the theory <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb97" href="#v2pb97" name="v2pb97">97</a>]</span>is
traceable in the eighth century. In this picture we have an early
example of those which have since become familiar in old Bibles. Pietro
d&rsquo;Orvieto painted this serpent-woman in his finest fresco, at
Pisa. Perhaps in no other picture has the genius of Mich&aelig;l Angelo
been more felicitous than in that on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel,
in which Lilith is portrayed. In this picture (<a href="#v2fig02">Fig.
2</a>) the marvellous beauty of his first wife appears to have awakened
the enthusiasm of Adam; and, indeed, it is quite in harmony with the
earlier myth that Lilith should be of greater beauty than Eve.</p>

<p>An artist and poet of our own time (Rossetti) has by both of his
arts celebrated the fatal beauty of Lilith. His Lilith, bringing
&lsquo;soft sleep,&rsquo; antedates, as I think, the fair devil of the
Rabbins, but is also the medi&aelig;val witch against whose beautiful
locks Mephistopheles warns Faust when she appears at the
Walpurgis-night orgie.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The rose and poppy are her flowers; for where</p>
<p class="line">Is he not found, O Lilith, whom shed scent</p>
<p class="line">And soft-shed kisses and soft sleep shall snare?</p>
<p class="line">Lo! as that youth&rsquo;s eyes burned at thine, so
went</p>
<p class="line">Thy spell through him, and left his straight neck
bent,</p>
<p class="line">And round his heart one strangling golden hair.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb98" href="#v2pb98" name=
"v2pb98">98</a>]</span></p>
<p>The potency of Lilith&rsquo;s tresses has probably its origin in the
hairy nature ascribed by the Rabbins to all demons (<i>shedim</i>), and
found fully represented in Esau. Perhaps the serpent-locks of Medusa
had a similar origin. Nay, there is a suggestion in Dante that these
tresses of Medusa may have once represented fascinating rather than
horrible serpents. As she approaches, Virgil is alarmed for his
brother-poet:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;Turn thyself back, and keep thy vision hid;</p>
<p class="line">For, if the Gorgon show, and then behold,</p>
<p class="line">&rsquo;Twould all be o&rsquo;er with e&rsquo;er
returning up.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="line">So did the master say; and he himself</p>
<p class="line">Turned me, and to my own hands trusted not,</p>
<p class="line">But that with his too he should cover me.</p>
<p class="line">O you that have a sane intelligence,</p>
<p class="line">Look ye unto the doctrine which herein</p>
<p class="line">Conceals itself &rsquo;neath the strange verses&rsquo;
veil.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e9626src" href="#xd20e9626" name=
"xd20e9626src">4</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">If this means that the security against evil is to
veil the eyes from it, Virgil&rsquo;s warning would be against a
beautiful seducer, similar to the warning given by Mephistopheles to
Faust against the fatal charms of Lilith. Since, however, even in the
time of Homer, the Gorgon was a popular symbol of terrors, the
possibility of a survival in Dante&rsquo;s mind of any more primitive
association with Medusa is questionable. The Pauline doctrine, that the
glory of a woman is her hair, no doubt had important antecedents: such
glory might easily be degraded, and every hair turn to a fatal
&lsquo;binder,&rsquo; like the one golden thread of Lilith round the
heart of her victim; or it might ensnare its owner. In Treves Cathedral
there is a curious old picture of a woman carried to hell by her
beautiful hair; one devil draws her by it, another is seated on her
back and drives her by locks of it as a bridle.</p>
<p>In the later developments of the myth of Lilith she <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb99" href="#v2pb99" name=
"v2pb99">99</a>]</span>was, among the Arabs, transformed to a Ghoul,
but in rabbinical legend she appears to have been influenced by the
story of Lamia, whose name is substituted for Lilith in the Vulgate.
Like Lilith, Lamia was robbed of her children, and was driven by
despair to avenge herself on all children.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e9635src" href="#xd20e9635" name="xd20e9635src">5</a> The name of
Lamia was long used to frighten Italian children, as that of Lilith was
by Hebrew nurses.</p>
<p>It is possible that the part assigned to Lilith in the temptation of
Eve may have been suggested by ancient Egyptian sculptures, which
represent the Tree of Life in Amenti (Paradise) guarded by the
Serpent-goddess Nu. One of these in the British Museum represents the
Osirian on his journey to heaven, and his soul in form of a
human-headed bird, drinking the water of Life as poured out to them
from a jar by the goddess who coils around the sacred sycamore, her
woman&rsquo;s bust and face appearing amid the branches much like
Lilith in our old pictures.</p>
<p>The Singhalese also have a kind of Lilith or Lamia whom they call
Bodrima, though she is not so much dreaded for the sake of children as
for her vindictive feelings towards men. She is the ghost of a woman
who died in childbirth and in great agony. She may be heard wailing in
the night, it is said, and if she meets any man will choke him to
death. When her wailing is heard men are careful to stay within doors,
but the women go forth with brooms in their hands and abuse Bodrima
with epithets. She fears women, especially when they carry brooms. But
the women have also some compassion for this poor ghost, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb100" href="#v2pb100" name=
"v2pb100">100</a>]</span>and often leave a lamp and some betel leaves
where she may get some warmth and comfort from them. If Bodrima be
fired at, there may be found, perhaps, a dead lizard near the spot in
the morning.</p>
<p>As protomartyr of female independence, Lilith suffered a fate not
unlike that of her sisters and successors in our own time who have
appealed from the legendary decision made in Eden: she became the
prototype of the &lsquo;strong-minded&rsquo; and
&lsquo;cold-hearted&rsquo; woman, and personification of the fatal
fascination of the passionless. Her special relation to children was
gradually expanded, and she was regarded as the perilous seducer of
young men, each of her victims perishing of unrequited passion. She was
ever young, and always dressed with great beauty. It would seem that
the curse upon her for forsaking Adam&mdash;that her children should
die in infancy&mdash;was escaped in the case of the children she had by
Sama&euml;l. She was almost as prolific as Echidna. Through all the
latter rabbinical lore it is repeated, &lsquo;Sama&euml;l is the fiery
serpent, Lilith the crooked serpent,&rsquo; and from their union came
Leviathan, Asmodeus, and indeed most of the famous devils.</p>
<p>There is an ancient Persian legend of the first man and woman,
Meschia and Meschiane, that they for a long time lived happily
together: they hunted together, and discovered fire, and made an axe,
and with it built them a hut. But no sooner had they thus set up
housekeeping than they fought terribly, and, after wounding each other,
parted. It is not said which remained ruler of the hut, but we learn
that after fifty years of divorce they were reunited.</p>
<p>These legends show the question of equality of the sexes to have
been a very serious one in early times. The story of Meschia and
Meschiane fairly represents primitive man living by the hunt; that of
Eden shows <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb101" href="#v2pb101" name=
"v2pb101">101</a>]</span>man entering on the work of agriculture. In
neither of these occupations would there be any reason why woman should
be so unequal as to set in motion the forces which have diminished her
physical stature and degraded her position. Women can still hunt and
fish, and they are quite man&rsquo;s equal in tilling the
soil.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e9655src" href="#xd20e9655" name=
"xd20e9655src">6</a></p>
<p>In all sex-mythology there are intimations that women were taken
captive. The proclamation of female subordination is made not only in
the legend of Eve&rsquo;s creation out of the man&rsquo;s rib, but in
the emphasis with which her name is declared to have been given her
because she was the Mother of all living. In the variously significant
legends of the Amazons they are said to have burned away their breasts
that they might use the bow: in the history of contemporary
Amazons&mdash;such as the female Areoi of Polynesia&mdash;the legend is
interpreted in the systematic slaughter of their children. In the hunt,
Meschia might be aided by Meschiane in many ways; in dressing the
garden Adam might find Lilith or Eve a &lsquo;help meet&rsquo; for the
work; but in the brutal r&eacute;gime of war the child disables woman,
and the affections of maternity render her man&rsquo;s inferior in the
work of butchery. Herakles wins <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb102"
href="#v2pb102" name="v2pb102">102</a>]</span>great glory by slaying
Hyppolite; but the legends of her later reappearances&mdash;as Libussa
at Prague, &amp;c.,&mdash;follow the less mythological story of the
Amazons given by Herodotus (IV. 112), who represents the Scythians as
gradually disarming them by sending out their youths to meet them with
dalliance instead of with weapons. The youths went off with their
captured captors, and from their union sprang the Sauromat&aelig;,
among whom the men and women dressed alike, and fought and hunted
together. But of the real outcome of that truce and union Tennyson can
tell us more than Herodotus: in his <i>Princess</i> we see the woman
whom maternity and war have combined to produce, her independence
betrayed by the tenderness of her nature. The surrender, once secured,
was made permanent for ages by the sentiments and sympathies born of
the child&rsquo;s appeal for compassion.</p>
<p>In primitive ages the child must in many cases have been a burthen
even to man in the struggle for existence; the population question
could hardly have failed to press its importance upon men, as it does
even upon certain animals; and it would be an especial interest to a
man not to have his hut overrun with offspring not his
own,&mdash;turning his fair labour into drudgery for their support, and
so cursing the earth for him. Thus, while Polyandry was giving rise to
the obvious complications under which it must ultimately disappear, it
would be natural that devils of lust should be invented to restrain the
maternal instinct. But as time went on the daughters of Eve would have
taken the story of her fall and hardships too much to heart. The pangs
and perils of childbirth were ever-present monitors whose warnings
might be followed too closely. The early Jewish laws bear distinct
traces of the necessity which had arrived for insisting on the command
to increase and multiply. Under these changed circumstances
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb103" href="#v2pb103" name=
"v2pb103">103</a>]</span>it would be natural that the story of a
recusant and passionless Eve should arise and suffer the penalties
undergone by Lilith,&mdash;the necessity of bearing, as captive, a vast
progeny against her will only to lose them again, and to long for human
children she did not bring forth and could not cherish. The too
passionate and the passionless woman are successively warned in the
origin and outcome of the myth.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e9676src"
href="#xd20e9676" name="xd20e9676src">7</a></p>
<p>It is a suggestive fact that the descendants of Adam should trace
their fall not to the independent Lilith, who asserted her equality at
cost of becoming the Devil&rsquo;s bride, but to the apparently
submissive Eve who stayed inside the garden. The serpent found out the
guarded and restrained woman as well as the free and defiant, and with
much more formidable results. For craft is the only weapon of the weak
against the strong. The submissiveness of the captive woman must have
been for a long time outward only. When Adam found himself among thorns
and briars he might have questioned whether much had been gained by
calling Eve his rib, when after all she really was a woman, and
prepared to take her intellectual rights from the Serpent if denied her
in legitimate ways. The question is, indeed, hardly out of date yet
when the genius of woman is compelled to act with subtlety and reduced
to exert its influence too often by intrigue.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that we find something like a similar development
to the two wives of Adam in Hindu mythology also. K&aacute;li and
D&uacute;rga have the same origin: the former is represented dancing on
the prostrate form of her &lsquo;lord and master,&rsquo; and she
becomes the demoness of violence, the mother of the diabolical
&lsquo;Calas&rsquo; of Singhalese <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb104" href="#v2pb104" name="v2pb104">104</a>]</span>demonolatry.
D&uacute;rga sacrificed herself for her husband&rsquo;s honour, and is
now adored. The counterpart of D&uacute;rga-worship is the Zenana
system. In countries where the Zenana system has not survived, but some
freedom has been gained for woman, it is probable that K&aacute;li will
presently not be thought of as necessarily trampling on man, and Lilith
not be regarded as the Devil&rsquo;s wife because she will not submit
to be the slave of man. When man can make him a home and garden which
shall not be a prison, and in which knowledge is unforbidden fruit,
Lilith will not have to seek her liberty by revolution against his
society, nor Eve hers by intrigue; unfitness for co-operation with the
ferocities of nature will leave her a help meet for the rearing of
children, and for the recovery and culture of every garden, whether
within or without the man who now asserts over woman a lordship
unnatural and unjust. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb105" href=

martial and hunting customs of the German women, as well as their
equality with men, may be traced in the vestiges of their decline.
<i>Hexe</i> (witch) is from <i>hag</i> (forest): the priestesses who
carried the Broom of Thor were called Hagdissen. Before the seventeenth
century the Hexe was called Drud or Trud (red folk, related to the
Lightning-god). But the famous female hunters and warriors of Wodan,
the Valkyries, were so called also; and the preservation of the epithet
(Trud) in the noble name Gertrude is a connecting link between the
German Amazons and the political power so long maintained by women in
the same country. Their office as priestesses probably marks a step
downward from their outdoor equality. By this route, as priestesses of
diabolised deities, they became witches; but many folk-legends made
these witches still great riders, and the Devil was said to transform
and ride them as dapplegrey mares. The chief charge against the
witches, that of carnal commerce with devils, is also significant. Like
Lilith, women became devils&rsquo; brides whenever they were not
content with sitting at home with the distaff and the child.</p>

</div>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In none of the ancient scriptures do we get back to
any theory or explanation of the origin of evil or of the enemies of
the gods. In a Persian text at Persepolis, of Darius I., Ahriman is
called with simplicity &lsquo;the Other&rsquo; (<i>Aniya</i>), and
&lsquo;the Hater&rsquo; (<i>Duvaisa&ntilde;t</i>, Zend
<i>tha&#299;sat</i>), and that is about as much as we are really told
about the devils of any race. Their existence is taken for granted. The
legends of rebellion in heaven and of angels cast down and transformed
to devils may supply an easy explanation to our modern theologians, but
when we trace them to their origin we discover that to the ancients
they had no such significance. The angels were cast down to Pits
prepared for them from the foundation of the world, and before it, and
when they fell it was into the hands of already existing enemies eager
to torment them. Nevertheless these accounts of rebellious spirits in
heaven are of great importance and merit our careful consideration.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that the Bible opens with an intimation of the
existence of this &lsquo;Other.&rsquo; Its second verse speaks of a
certain &lsquo;darkness upon the face of the deep.&rsquo; The word used
here is <i>Bohu</i>, which is identified as the Assyrian <i>Bahu</i>,
the Queen of Hades. In the inscription of Shalmaneser <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb106" href="#v2pb106" name=
"v2pb106">106</a>]</span>the word is used for &lsquo;abyss of
chaos.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e9717src" href="#xd20e9717"
name="xd20e9717src">1</a> Bahu is otherwise Gula, a form of Ishtar or
Allat, &lsquo;Lady of the House of Death,&rsquo; and an epithet of the
same female demon is Nin-cigal, &lsquo;Lady of the Mighty Earth.&rsquo;
The story of the Descent of Ishtar into Hades, the realm of Nin-cigal,
has already been told (p. 77); in that version Ishtar is the same as
Astarte, the Assyrian Venus. But like the moon with which she was
associated she waned and declined, and the beautiful legend of her
descent (like Persephone) into Hades seems to have found a variant in
the myth of Bel and the Dragon. There she is a sea-monster and is
called Tiamat (Thalatth of Berosus),&mdash;that is, &lsquo;the
Deep,&rsquo; over which rests the darkness described in Genesis i. 2.
The process by which the moon would share the evil repute of Tiamat is
obvious. In the Babylonian belief the dry land rested upon the abyss of
watery chaos from which it was drawn. This underworld ocean was shut in
by gates. They were opened when the moon was created to rule the
night&mdash;therefore Prince of Darkness. The formation by Anu of this
Moon-god (Uru) from Tiamat, might even have been suggested by the
rising of the tides under his sway. The Babylonians represent the Moon
as having been created before the Sun, and he emerged from &lsquo;a
boiling&rsquo; in the abyss. &lsquo;At the beginning of the month, at
the rising of the night, his horns are breaking through to shine on
heaven.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e9724src" href="#xd20e9724"
name="xd20e9724src">2</a> In the one Babylonian design, a seal in the
British Museum,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e9727src" href="#xd20e9727"
name="xd20e9727src">3</a> which seems referable to the legend of the
Fall of Man, the male figure has horns. It may have been that this male
Moon (Uru) was supposed to have been corrupted by some <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb107" href="#v2pb107" name=
"v2pb107">107</a>]</span>female emanation of Tiamat, and to have fallen
from a &lsquo;ruler of the night&rsquo; to an ally of the night. This
female corrupter, who would correspond to Eve, might in this way have
become mistress of the Moon, and ultimately identified with it.</p>
<p>Although the cause of the original conflict between the Abyss
beneath and the Heaven above is left by ancient inscriptions and
scriptures to imagination, it is not a very strained hypothesis that
ancient Chaos regarded the upper gods as aggressors on her domain in
the work of creation. &lsquo;When above,&rsquo; runs the Babylonian
legend, &lsquo;were not raised the heavens, and below on the earth a
plant had not grown ... the chaos (or water) Tiamat was the producing
mother of the whole of them.&rsquo; &lsquo;The gods had not sprung up,
any one of them.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e9734src" href=
"#xd20e9734" name="xd20e9734src">4</a> Indeed in the legend of the
conflict between Bel and the Dragon, on the Babylonian cylinders, it
appears that the god Sar addressed her as wife, and said, &lsquo;The
tribute to thy maternity shall be forced upon them by thy
weapons.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e9737src" href="#xd20e9737"
name="xd20e9737src">5</a> The Sun and Moon would naturally be drawn
into any contest between Overworld (with Light) and Underworld (with
Darkness).</p>
<p>Though Tiamat is called a Dragon, she was pictured by the
Babylonians only as a monstrous Griffin. In the Assyrian account of the
fight it will be seen that she is called a &lsquo;Serpent.&rsquo; The
link between the two&mdash;Griffin and Serpent&mdash;will be found, I
suspect, in Typhonic influence on the fable. In a hymn to Amen-Ra (the
Sun), copied about fourteenth century <span class="sc">b.c.</span> from
an earlier composition, as its translator, Mr. Goodwin, supposes, we
have the following:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The gods rejoice in his goodness who exalts those who
are lowly:</p>
<p class="line">Lord of the boat and barge,</p>

saves his feet:</p>
<p class="line">The gods rejoice:</p>
<p class="line">The servants of the Sun are in peace.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The allusion in the second line indicates that this

of Apophis.</p>
<p>We may read next the Accadian tablet (p. 256) which speaks of the
seven Hathors as neither male nor female, and as born in &lsquo;the
Deep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another Accadian tablet, translated by Mr. Sayce, speaks of these as
the &lsquo;baleful seven destroyers;&rsquo; as &lsquo;born in the
mountain of the sunset;&rsquo; as being Incubi. It is significantly
said:&mdash;&lsquo;Among the stars of heaven their watch they kept not,
in watching was their office.&rsquo; Here is a prim&aelig;val note of
treachery.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e9777src" href="#xd20e9777" name=

Herakles or Saviour. It will be noted that as yet Ishtar is in heaven.

<p>[Bel now offers to the Dragon to decide their quarrel by single
combat, which the Dragon accepts. This agrees with the representations
of the combat on Babylonian cylinders in Mr. Smith&rsquo;s

<p class="first">In the fragment just quoted we have the &lsquo;flaming
sword which turned every way&rsquo; (Gen. iii. 24). The seven distinct
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb112" href="#v2pb112" name=

the seven thunderbolts taken by Bel: they are now all virtually
gathered into the one form he combats, and are thus on their way to
form the seven-headed dragon of the Apocalypse, where Michael replaces
Bel.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e10048src" href="#xd20e10048" name=
"xd20e10048src">10</a> &lsquo;The angels, her allies who had come to

heaven&rsquo; which the apocalyptic dragon&rsquo;s tail drew to the

&lsquo;Tempter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At length we reach the brief but clear account of the &lsquo;Revolt
in Heaven&rsquo; found in a cuneiform tablet in the British Museum, and
translated by Mr. Fox Talbot:<a class="noteref" id="xd20e10056src"

<p class="line">The god of holy songs, Lord of religion and worship</p>
<p class="line">seated a thousand singers and musicians: and

<p class="line">who to his hymn were to respond in multitudes....</p>
<p class="line xd20e3317">With a loud cry of contempt they broke up his

</div>
<p class="first">It will be observed that there were already hostile
gods to whom these riotous angels were sent. It is clear that in both
the Egyptian and Assyrian cosmogonies the upper <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb113" href="#v2pb113" name=
"v2pb113">113</a>]</span>gods had in their employ many ferocious
monsters. Thus in the Book of Hades, Horus addresses a terrible
serpent: &lsquo;My Kheti, great fire, of which this flame in my eye is
the emission, and of which my children guard the folds, open thy mouth,
draw wide thy jaws, launch thy flame against the enemies of my father,
burn their bodies, consume their souls!<span class="corr" id=

"xd20e10095src" href="#xd20e10095" name="xd20e10095src">12</a> Many
such instances could be quoted. In this same book we find a great
serpent, Saa-Set, &lsquo;Guardian of the Earth.&rsquo; Each of the
twelve pylons of Hades is surmounted by its serpent-guards&mdash;except
one. What has become of that one? In the last inscription but one,
quoted in full, it will be observed (third line from the last) that
<i>eleven</i> (angel) tribes came in after Bel&rsquo;s battle to
inspect the slain dragon. The twelfth had revolted. These, we may
suppose, had listened to &lsquo;the serpent&rsquo;s voice&rsquo;
mentioned in the last fragment quoted.</p>
<p>We have thus distributed through these fragments all the elements
which, from Egyptian and Assyrian sources gathered around the legend of
the Serpent in Eden. The Tree of Knowledge and that of Life are not
included, and I have given elsewhere my reasons for believing these to
be importations from the ancient Aryan legend of the war between the
Devas and Asuras for the immortalising Amrita.</p>
<p>In the last fragment quoted we have also a notable statement, that
mankind were created to fill the places that had been occupied by the
fallen angels. It is probable that this notion supplied the basis of a
class of legends of which Lilith is type. She whose place Eve was
created to fill was a serpent-woman, and the earliest mention of her is
in the exorcism already quoted, found at Nineveh. In all probability
she is but another form of Gula, the fallen Istar and Queen of Hades;
in which case her conspiracy with <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb114" href="#v2pb114" name="v2pb114">114</a>]</span>the serpent
Sama&euml;l would be the Darkness which was upon the face of Bahu,
&lsquo;the Deep,&rsquo; in the second verse of the Bible.</p>
<p>The Bible opens with the scene of the gods conquering the Dragon of
Darkness with Light. There is a rabbinical legend, that when Light
issued from under the throne of God, the Prince of Darkness asked the
Creator wherefore he had brought Light into existence? God answered
that it was in order that he might be driven back to his abode of
darkness. The evil one asked that he might see that; and entering the
stream of Light, he saw across time and the world, and beheld the face
of the Messiah. Then he fell upon his face and cried, &lsquo;This is he
who shall lay low in ruin me and all the inhabitants of
hell!&rsquo;</p>
<p>What the Prince of Darkness saw was the vision of a race: beginning
with the words (Gen. i. 3, 4), &lsquo;God said, Let there be Light; and
there was Light; and God saw the Light that it was good; and God
divided between the Light and the Darkness;&rsquo; ending with Rev. xx.
1, 2, &lsquo;And I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of
the bottomless pit, and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on
the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound
him a thousand years.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb115"

<p class="first">&lsquo;Rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them!
Woe to the earth and the sea! for the devil is come down to you, having
great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.&rsquo;
This passage from the Book of Revelations is the refrain of many and
much earlier scriptures. The Assyrian accounts of the war in heaven,
given in the preceding chapter, by no means generally support the story
that the archdragon was slain by Bel. Even the one that does describe
the chief dragon&rsquo;s death leaves her comrades alive, and the
balance of testimony is largely in favour of the theory which
prevailed, that the rebellious angels were merely cast out of heaven,
and went to swell the ranks of the dark and fearful abode which from
the beginning had been peopled by the enemies of the gods. The nature
of this abode is described in various passages of the Bible, and in
many traditions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the
inhabitants of the land.&rsquo; So said Jeremiah (i. 14), in pursuance
of nearly universal traditions as to the region of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb116" href="#v2pb116" name=
"v2pb116">116</a>]</span>space in which demons and devils had their
abode. &lsquo;Hell is naked before him,&rsquo; says Job (xxvi. 6),
&lsquo;and destruction hath no covering. He stretcheth out the north
over the empty place.&rsquo; According to the Hebrew mythology this
habitation of demons was a realm of perpetual cold and midnight, which
Jehovah, in creating the world, purposely left chaotic; so it was
prepared for the Devil and his angels at the foundation of the
world.</p>
<p>Although this northern hell was a region of disorder, so far as the
people of Jehovah and the divine domain were concerned, they had among
themselves a strong military and aristocratic government. It was
disorder perfectly systematised. The anarchical atmosphere of the
region is reflected in the abnormal structures ascribed to the many
devils with whose traits Jewish and Arabic folklore is familiar, and
which are too numerous to be described here. Such a devil, for
instance, is Bedargon, &lsquo;hand-high,&rsquo; with fifty heads and
fifty-six hearts, who cannot strike any one or be struck, instant death
ensuing to either party in such an attack. A more dangerous devil is
Ketef, identified as the &lsquo;terror from the chambers&rsquo; alluded
to by Jeremiah (xxxii. 25), &lsquo;Bitter Pestilence.&rsquo; His name
is said to be from <i>kataf</i>, &lsquo;cut and split,&rsquo; because
he divides the course of the day; and those who are interested to
compare Hebrew and Hindu myths may find it interesting to note the
coincidences between Ketef and Ketu, the cut-off tail of R&aacute;hu,
and source of pestilence.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e10147src" href=
"#xd20e10147" name="xd20e10147src">1</a> Ketef reigns neither in the
dark or day, but between the two; his power over the year is limited to
the time between June 17 and July 9, during which it was considered
dangerous to flog children or let them go out after four <span class=
"sc">P.M.</span> Ketef is calf-headed, and consists of hide, hair, and
eyes; he rolls like a cask; he has a terrible horn, but his chief
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb117" href="#v2pb117" name=
"v2pb117">117</a>]</span>terror lies in an evil eye fixed in his heart
which none can see without instant death. The arch-fiend who reigns
over the infernal host has many Court Fools&mdash;probably meteors and
comets&mdash;who lead men astray.</p>
<p>All these devils have their regulations in their own domain, but, as
we have said, their laws mean disorder in that part of the universe
which belongs to the family of Jehovah. In flying about the world they
are limited to places which are still chaotic or waste. They haunt such
congenial spots as rocks and ruins, and frequent desert, wilderness,
dark mountains, and the ruins of human habitations. They can take
possession of a wandering star.</p>
<p>There is a pretty Talmudic legend of a devil having once gone to
sleep, when some one, not seeing him of course, set down a cask of wine
on his ears. In leaping up the devil broke the cask, and being tried
for it, was condemned to repay the damage at a certain period. The
period having elapsed before the money was brought, the devil was asked
the cause of the delay. He replied that it was very difficult for
devils to obtain money, because men were careful to keep it locked or
tied up; and &lsquo;we have no power,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to take
from anything bound or sealed up, nor can we take anything that is
measured or counted; we are permitted to take only what is free or
common.&rsquo;</p>
<p>According to one legend the devils were specially angered, because
Jehovah, when he created man, gave him dominion over things in the sea
(Gen. i. 28), that being a realm of unrest and tempest which they
claimed as belonging to themselves. They were denied control of the
life that is in the sea, though permitted a large degree of power over
its waters. Over the winds their rule was supreme, and it was only by
reducing certain demons to slavery that Solomon was able to ride in a
wind-chariot.</p>
<p>Out of these several realms of order and disorder in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb118" href="#v2pb118" name=
"v2pb118">118</a>]</span>nature were evolved the angels and the devils
which were supposed to beset man. The first man is said to have been
like an angel. From the instant of his creation there attended him two
spirits, whom the rabbins found shadowed out in the sentence,
&lsquo;Jehovah-Elohim formed man of the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
soul&rsquo; (Gen. ii. 7). This &lsquo;breath of life&rsquo; was a holy
spirit, and stood on Adam&rsquo;s right; the &lsquo;living soul&rsquo;
was a restless spirit on his left, which continually moved up and down.
When Adam had sinned, this restless spirit became a diabolical spirit,
and it has ever acted as mediator between man and the realm of
anarchy.</p>
<p>It has been mentioned that in the Assyrian legends of the Revolt in
Heaven we find no adequate intimation of the motive by which the rebels
were actuated. It is said they interrupted the heavenly song, that they
brought on an eclipse, that they afflicted human beings with disease;
but why they did all this is not stated. The motive of the serpent in
tempting Eve is not stated in Genesis. The theory which C&aelig;dmon
and Milton have made so familiar, that the dragons aspired to rival
Jehovah, and usurp the throne of Heaven, must, however, have been
already popular in the time of Isaiah. In his rhapsody concerning the
fall of Babylon, he takes his rhetoric from the story of Bel and the
Dragon, and turns a legend, as familiar to every Babylonian as that of
St. George and the Dragon now is to Englishmen, into an illustration of
their own doom. The invective is directed against the King of Babylon,
consequently the sex of the devil is changed; but the most remarkable
change is in the ascription to Lucifer of a clear purpose to rival the
Most High, and seize the throne of heaven.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy
coming, it stirreth up the (spirits of) the dead, even <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb119" href="#v2pb119" name=
"v2pb119">119</a>]</span>all the chief ones (great goats) of the earth:
it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations
(demon-begotten aliens). All these shall say unto thee, Art thou also
become weak as we? Art thou become like unto us? Thy splendour is
brought down to the underworld, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is
spread under thee, and the worms cover thee. How art thou fallen, O
Lucifer (Daystar), son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the
ground which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thy heart,
I will ascend into (the upper) heaven, I will exalt my throne above the
stars (archangels) of God: I will sit (reign) also upon the mount of
the congregation (the assembly of the enemies of God) in the sides of
the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds (the
thunder-throne of Jehovah); I will be like the Most High. Yet shalt
thou be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e10178src" href="#xd20e10178" name=

<p>In this passage we mark the arena of the combat shifted from heaven
to earth. It is not the throne of heaven but that of the world at which
the fiends now aim. Nay, there is confession in every line of the
prophecy that the enemy of Jehovah <i>has</i> usurped his throne. Hell
has prevailed, and Lucifer is the Prince of this World. The celestial
success has not been maintained on earth. This would be the obvious
fact to a humiliated, oppressed, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb120"
href="#v2pb120" name="v2pb120">120</a>]</span>heavily-taxed people, who
believed themselves the one family on earth sprung from Jehovah, and
their masters the offspring of demons. This situation gave to the vague
traditions of a single combat between Bel and the Dragon, about an
eclipse or a riot, the significance which it retained ever afterward of
a mighty conflict on earth between the realms of Light and Darkness,
between which the Elohim had set a boundary-line (Gen. i. 4) in the
beginning.</p>
<p>A similar situation returned when the Jews were under the sway of
Rome, and then all that had ever been said of Babylon was repeated
against Rome under the name of Edom. It recurred in the case of those
Jews who acknowledged Jesus as their Messiah: in the pomp and glory of
the C&aelig;sars they beheld the triumph of the Powers of Darkness, and
the burthen of Isaiah against Lucifer was raised again in that of the
Apocalypse against the seven-headed Dragon. It is notable how these
writers left out of sight the myth of Eden so far as it did not belong
to their race. Isaiah does not say anything even of the serpent. The
Apocalypse says nothing of the two wonderful trees, and the serpent
appears only as a Dragon from whom the woman is escaping, by whom she
is not at all tempted. The shape of the Devil, and the Combat with him,
have always been determined by dangers and evils that are actual, not
such as are arch&aelig;ological. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb121"
href="#v2pb121" name="v2pb121">121</a>]</span></p>
<p>A gipsy near Edinburgh gave me his version of the combat between God
and Satan as follows. &lsquo;When God created the universe and all
things in it, Satan tried to create a rival universe. He managed to
match everything pretty well except man. There he failed; and God to
punish his pride cast him down to the earth and bound him with a chain.
But this chain was so long that Satan was able to move over the whole
face of the earth!&rsquo; There had got into this wanderer&rsquo;s head
some bit of the Babylonian story, and it was mingled with Gnostic
traditions about Ildabaoth; but there was also a quaint suggestion in
Satan&rsquo;s long chain of the migration of this mythical combat not
only round the world, but through the ages.</p>
<p>The early followers of Christ came before the glories of Paganism
with the legend that the lowly should inherit the earth. And though
they speedily surrendered to the rulers of the world in Rome, and made
themselves into a christian aristocracy, when they came into Northern
Europe the christians were again brought to confront with an humble
system the religion of thrones and warriors. St. Gatien celebrating
mass in a cavern beside the Loire, meant as much weakness in presence
of Paganism as the Huguenots felt twelve centuries later hiding in the
like caverns from St. Gatien&rsquo;s priestly successors.</p>
<p>The burthen of Isaiah is heard again, and with realistic intensity,
in the seventh century, and in the north, with our patriarchial poet
C&aelig;dmon.</p>

<p>Whether this spirited description was written by C&aelig;dmon, and
whether it is of his century, are questions unimportant to the present
inquiry. The poem represents a medi&aelig;val notion which long
prevailed, and which characterised the Mysteries, that Satan and his
comrades were humiliated from the highest angelic rank to a hell
already prepared and peopled with devils, and were there, and by those
devils, severely punished. One of the illuminations of the C&aelig;dmon
manuscript, preserved in the Bodleian Library, shows Satan undergoing
his torment (<a href="#v2fig03">Fig. 3</a>). <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb126" href="#v2pb126" name=
"v2pb126">126</a>]</span>He is bound over something like a gridiron,
and four devils are torturing him, the largest using a scourge with six
prongs. His face manifests great suffering. His form is mainly human,
but his bushy tail and animal feet indicate that he has been
transformed to a devil similar to those who chastise him.</p>
<p>On C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s foundation Milton built his gorgeous
edifice. His Satan is an ambitious and very English lord, in whom are
reflected the whole aristocracy of England in their hatred and contempt
of the holy Puritan Commonwealth, the Church of Christ as he deemed it.
The ages had brought round a similar situation to that which confronted
the Jews at Babylon, the early Christians of Rome, and their
missionaries among the proud pagan princes of the north. The Church had
long allied itself with the earlier Lucifers of the north, and now
represented the proud empire of a satanic aristocracy, and the
persecuted Nonconformists represented the authority of the King of
kings. In the English palace, and in the throne of Canterbury, Milton
saw his Beelzebub and his Satan.</p>

<p>This adaptation of the imagery of Isaiah concerning Lucifer has in
it all the thunder hurled by Cromwell against Charles. Even a Puritan

<p class="first">The Bel whom Milton saw was Cromwell, and the Dragon
that serpent of English oppression which the Dictator is trampling on
in a well-known engraving of his time. In the history of the
Reformation the old legend did manifold duty again, as in the picture
(<a href="#v2fig13">Fig. 13</a>) by Luther&rsquo;s friend Lucas
Cranach.</p>
<p>It would seem that in the course of time Bel and the Dragon became
sufficiently close allies for their worshippers <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb128" href="#v2pb128" name=
"v2pb128">128</a>]</span>to feed and defend them both with equal
devotion, and for Daniel to explode them both in carrying on the fight
of his deity against the gods of Babylon. This story of Bel is
apocryphal as to the canon, but highly significant as to the history we
are now considering. Although the Jews maintained their struggle
against &lsquo;principalities and powers&rsquo; long after it had been
a forlorn hope, and never surrendered, nor made alliance with the
Dragon, the same cannot be said of those who appropriated their title
of &lsquo;the chosen of God,&rsquo; counterfeited their covenant, and
travestied their traditions. The alliance of Christianity and the
Dragon has not been nominal, but fearfully real. In fulfilling their
mission of &lsquo;inheriting the earth,&rsquo; the &lsquo;meek&rsquo;
called around them and pressed into their service agents and weapons
more diabolical than any with which the Oriental imagination had
peopled the abode of devils in the north.</p>
<p>At a Fair in Tours (August 1878) I saw two exhibitions which were
impressive enough in the light they cast through history. One was a
shrunken and sufficiently grotesque production by puppets of the
Medi&aelig;val &lsquo;Mystery&rsquo; of Hell. Nearly every old scheme
and vision of the underworld was represented in the scene. The three
Judges sat to hear each case. A devil rang a bell whenever any culprit
appeared at the gate. The accused was ushered in by a winged
devil&mdash;Satan, the Accuser&mdash;who, by the show-woman&rsquo;s
lips, stated the charges against each with an eager desire to make him
or her out as wicked as possible. A devil with pitchfork received the
sentenced, and shoved them down into a furnace. There was an array of
brilliant dragons around, but they appeared to have nothing to do
beyond enjoying the spectacle. But this exhibition which was styled
&lsquo;Twenty minutes in Hell,&rsquo; was poor and faint beside the
neighbouring exhibition of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb129" href=
"#v2pb129" name="v2pb129">129</a>]</span>the real Hell, in which Europe
had been tortured for fifteen centuries. Some industrious Germans had
got together in one large room several hundreds of the instruments of
torture by which the nations of the West were persuaded to embrace
Christianity. Every limb, sinew, feature, bone, and nerve of the human
frame had suggested to christian inventiveness some ingenious device by
which it might be tortured. Wheels on which to break bones, chairs of
anguish, thumbscrews, the iron Virgin whose embrace pierced through
every vital part; the hunger-mask which renewed for Christ&rsquo;s sake
the exact torment of Tantalus; even the machine which bore the very
name of the enemy that was cast down&mdash;the Dragon&rsquo;s Head! By
such instrumentalities came those quasi-miraculous &lsquo;Triumphs of
the Cross,&rsquo; of which so much has been said and sung! The most
salient phenomenon of christian history is the steady triumph of the
Dragon. Misleader and Deceiver to the last, he is quite willing to
sprinkle his fork and rack with holy water, to cross himself, to label
his caldrons &lsquo;divine justice,&rsquo; to write CHRIST upon his
forehead; by so doing he was able to spring his infernal engine on the
best nations, and cow the strongest hearts, till from their pallid lips
were wrung the &lsquo;confessions of faith,&rsquo; or the last cry of
martyred truth. So was he able to assault the pure heavens once more,
to quench the stars of human faith and hope, and generate a race of
polite, learned, and civilised hypocrites. But the ancient sunbeams are
after him: the mandate has again gone forth, &lsquo;Let there be
light,&rsquo; and the Light that now breaks forth is not of that kind
which respects the limit of Darkness. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

Isaiah xiv. It may appear as if in this personification of a fallen
star we have entered a different mythological region from that
represented by the Assyrian tablets; but it is not so. The demoniac
forms of Ishtar, Astarte, are fallen stars also. She appears in Greece
as Artemis Astrateia, whose worship Pausanias mentions as coming from
the East. Her development is through Asteria (Greek form of Ishtar), in
whose myth is hidden much valuable Babylonian lore. Asteria was said to
have thrown herself into the sea, and been changed into the island
called Asteria, from its having fallen like a star from heaven. Her
suicide was to escape from the embraces of Zeus, and her escape from
him in form of a quail, as well as her fate, may be instructively
compared with the story of Lilith, who flew out of Eden on wings to
escape from Adam, and made an effort to drown herself in the Red Sea.
The diabolisation of Asteria (the fallen star) was through her daughter
Hecate. Hecate was the female Titan who was the most potent ally of the
gods. Her rule was supreme under Zeus, and all the gifts valued by
mortals were believed to proceed from her; but she was severely
judicial, and rigidly withheld all blessings from such as did not
deserve them. Thus she was, as the searching eye of Zeus, a star-spy
upon earth. Such spies, as we have repeatedly had occasion to mention
in this work, are normally developed into devils. From professional
detectives they become accusers and instigators. Ishtar of the
Babylonians, Asteria of the Greeks, and the Day-star of the Hebrews are
male and female forms of the same personification: Hecate with her
torch (<span class="trans" title="hekatos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&#7957;&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>,
&lsquo;far-shooting&rsquo;) and Lucifer (&lsquo;light-bringer&rsquo; on

<p class="first">This is the picture of the god of War. Upon it the
comment in <i>Emek Hammelech</i> is: &lsquo;The colour of the godless
Sama&euml;l and of all his princes and lords has the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb131" href="#v2pb131" name=
"v2pb131">131</a>]</span>aspect of red fire; and all their emanations
are red. Sama&euml;l is red, also his horse, his sword, his raiment,
and the ground beneath him, are red. In the future the Holy God shall
wear his raiment.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e10677src" href=
"#xd20e10677" name="xd20e10677src">2</a> Sama&euml;l is leader of the
Opposition. He is the Soul of the fiery planet Mars. He is the Creator
and inspirer of all Serpents. Azazel, demon of the Desert, is his First
Lord. He was the terrestrial Chief around whom the fallen angels
gathered, and his great power was acknowledged. All these characters
the ancient Rabbins found blended in his name. Simm&eacute; (dazzling),
S&oacute;me (blinding), Sem&oacute;l (the left side), and Samhammaveth
(deadly poison), were combined in the terrible name of Sama&euml;l. He
ruled over the <i>sinister</i> Left. When Moses, in war with the
Amalekites, raised his ten fingers, it was a special invocation to the
Ten Sephiroth, Divine Emanations, because he knew the power which the
Amalekites got from Sama&euml;l might turn his own left hand against
Israel.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e10683src" href="#xd20e10683" name=
"xd20e10683src">3</a> The scapegoat was a sacrifice to him through
Azazel.</p>
<p>Sama&euml;l is the mythologic expression and embodiment of the
history of Esau, afterward Edom. Jacob and Esau represented the sheep
and the goat, divided in the past and to be sundered for ever. As Jacob
by covering his flesh with goat-skins obtained his father&rsquo;s
blessing due to Esau, the Israelites wandering through the wilderness
(near Edom&rsquo;s forbidden domain) seemed to have faith that the
offering of a goat would convince his Viceroy Azazel that they were
orthodox Edomites. The redness of Sama&euml;l begins with the red
pottage from which Esau was called Edom. The English version does not
give the emphasis with which Esau is said to have called for the
pottage&mdash;&ldquo;the red! the red!&rdquo; The characteristics
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb132" href="#v2pb132" name=
"v2pb132">132</a>]</span>ascribed to Esau in the legend are merely a
saga built on the local names with which he was associated.
&lsquo;Edom&rsquo; means red, and &lsquo;Seir&rsquo; means hairy. It
probably meant the &lsquo;Shaggy Mountains.&rsquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e10690src" href="#xd20e10690" name="xd20e10690src">4</a></p>
<p>It is interesting to observe the parting of the human and the
theological myths in this story. Jacob is the third person of a
patriarchal trinity,&mdash;Abraham the Heavenly Father, Isaac the
Laugher (the Sun), and Jacob the Impostor or Supplanter. As the moon
supplants the sun, takes hold of his heel, shines with his light, so
does Jacob supplant his elder brother; and all the deadliness ascribed
to the Moon, and other Third Persons of Trinities, was inherited by
Jacob until his name was changed by euphemism. As the impartial sun
shines for good and evil, the smile of Isaac, the Laugher, promised
great blessings to both of his sons. The human myth therefore
represents both of them gaining great power and wealth, and after a
long feud they are reconciled. This feature of the legend we shall
consider hereafter. Jehovah has another interest to be secured. He had
declared that one should serve the other; that they should be cursed
who cursed Jacob; and he said, &lsquo;Jacob have I loved, Esau have I
hated.&rsquo; Jahvistic theology had here something more important than
two brothers to harmonise; namely a patriarch&rsquo;s blessing and a
god&rsquo;s curse. It was contrary to all orthodoxy that a man whom
Jehovah hated should possess the blessings of life; it was equally
unorthodox that a father&rsquo;s blessing should not carry with it
every advantage promised. It had to be recorded that Esau became
powerful, lived by his sword, and had great possessions.</p>
<p>It had also to be recorded that &lsquo;Edom revolted from under the
hand of Judah and made a king unto themselves,&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb133" href="#v2pb133" name=
"v2pb133">133</a>]</span>and that such independence continued
&lsquo;unto this day&rsquo; (2 Kings viii. 20, 22). There was thus no
room for the exhibition of Jacob&rsquo;s superiority,&mdash;that is of
Israel&rsquo;s priority over Edom,&mdash;in this world; nor yet any
room to carry out Isaac&rsquo;s curse on all who cursed Jacob, and the
saying: &lsquo;Jacob have I loved, Esau have I hated, and laid his
mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the
wilderness&rsquo; (Mal. i.).</p>
<p>Answers to such problems as these evolve themselves slowly but
inevitably. The agonised cry of the poor girl in Browning&rsquo;s
poem&mdash;&lsquo;There may be heaven, there must be
hell&rsquo;&mdash;marks the direction in which necessity led human
speculation many ages before her. A future had to be invented for the
working out of the curse on Esau, who on earth had to fulfil his
father&rsquo;s blessing by enjoying power, wealth, and independence of
his brother. In that future his greatness while living was repaid by
his relegation to the desert and the rock with the he-goat for his
support. Esau was believed to have been changed into a terrible hairy
devil.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e10707src" href="#xd20e10707" name=
"xd20e10707src">5</a> But still there followed him in his phantasmal
transformation a ghostly environment of his former power and greatness;
the boldest and holiest could not afford to despise or set aside that
&lsquo;share&rsquo; which had been allotted him in the legend, and
could not be wholly set aside in the invisible world.</p>
<p>Jacob&rsquo;s share began with a shrewd bargain with his imprudent
brother. Jacob by his cunning in the breeding of the streaked animals
(Gen. xxx.), by which he outwitted Laban, and other man&oelig;uvres,
was really the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb134" href="#v2pb134"
name="v2pb134">134</a>]</span>cause of bringing on the race called
after him that repute for extortion, affixed to them in such figures as
Shylock, which they have found it so hard to live down. In becoming the
great barterers of the East, their obstacle was the plunderer sallying
forth from the mountain fastnesses or careering over the desert. These
were the traditional descendants of Esau, who gradually included the
Ishmaelites as well as the Edomites, afterwards merged in the Idumeans.
But as the tribal distinctions became lost, the ancient hostility
survived in the abstract form of this satan of
Strife&mdash;Sama&euml;l. He came to mean the spirit that stirs up
antagonism between those who should be brethren. He finally became, and
among the more superstitious Jews still is, instigator of the cruel
persecutions which have so long pursued their race, and the prejudices
against them which survive even in countries to whose wealth, learning,
and arts they have largely contributed. In Jewish countries Edom has
long been a name for the power of Rome and Romanism, somewhat in the
same way as the same are called &lsquo;Babylon&rsquo; by some
christians. Jacob, when passing into the wilderness of Edom, wrestled
with the invisible power of Esau, or Sama&euml;l, and had not been able
to prevail except with a lame thigh,&mdash;a part which, in every
animal, Israel thereafter held sacred to the Opposing Power and
abstained from eating. A rabbinical legend represents Jacob as having
been bitten by a serpent while he was lingering about the boundary of
Edom, and before his gift of goats and other cattle had been offered to
his brother. The fiery serpents which afflicted Israel were universally
attributed to Sama&euml;l, and the raising of the Brazen Serpent for
the homage of the people was an instance of the uniform deference to
Esau&rsquo;s power in his own domain which was long inculcated.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb135" href="#v2pb135" name=
"v2pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<p>As I write, fiery Mars, near enough for the astronomer to detect its
moons, is a wondrous phenomenon in the sky. Beneath it fearful famine
is desolating three vast countries, war is raging between two powerful
nations, and civil strife is smiting another ere it has fairly
recovered from the wounds of a foreign struggle. The dismal conditions
seem to have so little root in political necessity that one might
almost be pardoned even now for dreaming that some subtle influence has
come among men from the red planet that has approached the earth. How
easy then must it have been in a similar conjunction of earthly and
celestial phenomena to have imagined Sama&euml;l, the planetary
Spectre, to be at work with his fatal fires! Whatever may have been the
occasion, the red light of Mars at an early period fixed upon that
planet the odium of all the burning, blighting, desert-producing powers
of which it was thought necessary to relieve the adorable Sun. It was
believed that all &lsquo;born under&rsquo; that planet were
quarrelsome. And it was part of the popular Jewish belief in the
ultimate triumph of good over evil that under Mars the Messias was to
be born.</p>
<p>We may regard Esau-Sama&euml;l then as the Devil of Strife. His
traditional son Cain was like himself a &lsquo;murderer from the
beginning;&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e10726src" href=
"#xd20e10726" name="xd20e10726src">6</a> but in that early period the
conflict was between the nomad and the huntsman on one side, on the
other the agriculturist and the cattle-breeder, who was never regarded
as a noble figure among the Semitic tribes. In the course of time some
Semitic tribes became agriculturists, and among them, in defiance of
his arch&aelig;ological character, Sama&euml;l was saddled with the
evils that beset them. As an ox he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb136" href="#v2pb136" name="v2pb136">136</a>]</span>brought
rinderpest. But his visible appearance was still more generally that of
the raven, the wild ass, the hog which brought scurvy; while in shape
of a dog he was so generally believed to bring deadly disease, that it
would seem as if &lsquo;hydrophobia&rsquo; was specially attributed to
him.</p>
<p>In process of time benignant Peace dwelt more and more with the
agriculturists, but still among the Israelites the tradesman was the
&lsquo;coming man,&rsquo; and to him peace was essential. The huntsman,
of the Esau clan, figures in many legends, of which the following is
translated from the Arabic by Lane:&mdash;There was a huntsman who from
a mountain cave brought some honey in his water-skin, which he offered
to an oilman; when the oilman opened the skin a drop of honey fell
which a bird ate; the oilman&rsquo;s cat sprang on the bird and killed
it; the huntsman&rsquo;s hound killed the cat; the oilman killed the
dog; the huntsman killed the oilman; and as the two men belonged to
different villages, their inhabitants rose against each other in
battle, &lsquo;and there died of them a great multitude, the number of
whom none knoweth but God, whose name be exalted!&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e10733src" href="#xd20e10733" name=
"xd20e10733src">7</a></p>
<p>Esau&rsquo;s character as a wild huntsman is referred to in another
chapter. It is as the genius of strife and nomadic war that he more
directly stands in contrast with his &lsquo;supplanter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>From the wild elemental demons of storm and tempest of the most
primitive age to this Devil of Strife, the human mind has associated
evil with unrest. &lsquo;The wicked are like the troubled sea when it
cannot rest.&rsquo; Such is the burthen of the Japanese Oni throned in
the heart of the hurricane, of the wild huntsman issuing forth at the
first note of war, of Edom hating the victories <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb137" href="#v2pb137" name=
"v2pb137">137</a>]</span>of peace, living by the sword. The prophecy
that the Prince of Peace should be born under the planet Mars is a
strange and mystical suggestion. In a powerful poem by Thomas Aird,
&lsquo;The Devil&rsquo;s Dream,&rsquo; the last fearful doom of
Satan&rsquo;s vision is imprisonment beneath a lake for ever
still,&mdash;the Spirit of Unrest condemned for ever to the realm of
absolute stillness!</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the preceding chapter it was noted that there were
two myths wrapped up in the story of Jacob and Esau,&mdash;the one
theological, the other human. The former was there treated, the latter
may be considered here. Rabbinical theology has made the Jewish race
adopt as their founder that tricky patriarch whom Shylock adopted as
his model; but any censure on them for that comes with little grace
from christians who believe that they are still enjoying a covenant
which Jacob&rsquo;s extortions and treacheries were the
divinely-adopted means of confirming. It is high time that the Jewish
people should repudiate Jacob&rsquo;s proceedings, and if they do not
give him his first name (&lsquo;Impostor&rsquo;) back again, at least
withdraw from him the name Israel. But it is still more important for
mankind to study the phases of their civilisation, and not attribute to
any particular race the spirit of a legend which represents an epoch of
social development throughout the world.</p>
<p>When Rebekah asked Jehovah why her unborn babes struggled in her
womb, he answered, &lsquo;Two nations are in thy womb. One people shall
be stronger than the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb139" href=
"#v2pb139" name="v2pb139">139</a>]</span>other people; the elder shall
be subject to the younger.&rsquo; What peoples these were is described
in the blessings of Jacob on the two representatives when they had
grown up to be, the one red and hairy, a huntsman; the other a quiet
man, dwelling in tents and builder of cattle-booths.</p>
<p>Jacob&mdash;cunning, extortionate, fraudulent in spirit even when
technically fair&mdash;is not a pleasing figure in the eyes of the
nineteenth century. But he does not belong to the nineteenth century.
His contest was with Esau. The very names of them belong to mythology;
they are not individual men; they are conflicting tendencies and
interests of a primitive period. They must be thought of as Israel and
Edom historically; morally, as the Barter principle and the Bandit
principle.</p>
<p>High things begin low. Astronomy began as Astrology; and when Trade
began there must have been even more trickery about it than there is
now. Conceive of a world made up of nomadic tribes engaged in perpetual
warfare. It is a commerce of killing. If a tribe desires the richer
soil or larger possessions of another, the method is to exterminate
that other. But at last there rises a tribe either too weak or too
peaceful to exterminate, and it proposes to barter. It challenges its
neighbours to a contest of wits. They try to get the advantage of each
other in bargains; they haggle and cheat; and it is not heroic at all,
but it is the beginning of commerce and peace.</p>
<p>But the Dukes of Edom as they are called will not enter into this
compact. They have not been used to it; they are always outwitted at a
bargain; just like those other red men in the West of America, whose
lands are bought with beads, and their territorial birthright taken for
a mess of pottage. They prefer to live by the hunt <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb140" href="#v2pb140" name=
"v2pb140">140</a>]</span>and by the sword. Then between these two
peoples is an eternal feud, with an occasional truce, or, in biblical
phrase, &lsquo;reconciliation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Surrounded by a commercial civilisation, with its prosaic virtues
and its petty vices, we cannot help admiring much about the Duke of
Edom, non-producer though he be. Brave, impulsive, quick to forgive as
to resent; generous, as people can afford to be when they may give what
they never earned; his gallant qualities cast a certain meanness over
his grasping brother, the Israelite. It is a healthy sign in youth to
admire such qualities. The boy who delights in Robin Hood; the youth
who feels a stir of enthusiasm when he reads Schiller&rsquo;s
<i>Robbers</i>; the <i>ennuy&eacute;s</i> of the clubs and the roughs,
with unfulfilled capacities for adventure in them, who admire
&lsquo;the gallant Turk,&rsquo; are all lingering in the nomadic age.
They do not think of things but of persons. They are impressed by the
barbaric dash. The splendour of warriors hides trampled and decimated
peasantries; their courage can gild atrocities. Beside such captivating
qualities and thrilling scenes how poor and commonplace appear thrifty
rusticity, and the cautious, selfish, money-making tradesmen!</p>
<p>But fine and heroic as the Duke of Edom may appear in the distance,
it is best to keep him at a distance. When Robin Hood reappeared on
Blackheath lately, his warmest admirers were satisfied to hear he was
securely lodged in gaol. The Jews had just the same sensations about
the Dukes of Edom. They saw that tribe near to, and lived in daily
dread of them. They were hirsute barbarians, dwelling amid mountain
fastnesses, and lording it over a vast territory. The weak tribe of the
plains had no sooner got together some herds and a little money, than
those dashing Edomites fell upon them and carried away their savings
and substance in a day. This made <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb141" href="#v2pb141" name="v2pb141">141</a>]</span>the bartering
tribe all the more dependent on their cunning. They had to match their
wits against, the world; and they have had to do the same to this day,
when it is a chief element of their survival that their thrift is of
importance to the business and finance of Europe. But in the myth it is
shown that Trade, timorous as it is in presence of the sword, may have
a magnanimity of its own. The Supplanter of Edom is haunted by the
wrong he has done his elder brother, and driven him to greater
animosity. He resolves to seek him, offer him gifts, and crave
reconciliation. It is easy to put an unfavourable construction upon his
action, but it is not necessary. The Supplanter, with droves of cattle,
a large portion of his possessions, passes out towards perilous Edom,
unarmed, undefended, except by his amicable intentions towards the
powerful chieftain he had wronged. At the border of the hostile kingdom
he learns that the chieftain is coming to meet him with four hundred
men. He is now seized, with a mighty spirit of Fear. He sends on the
herdsmen with the herds, and remains alone. During the watches of the
night there closes upon him this phantom of Fear, with its presage of
Death. The tricky tradesman has met his Conscience, and it is girt
about with Terror. But he feels that his nobler self is with it, and
that he will win. Finely has Charles Wesley told the story in his
hymn:&mdash;</p>

before God, that thou mightest be favourable to me.&rsquo; The proud
Duke is disarmed. The brothers embrace and weep together. The chieftain
declines the presents, and is only induced to accept them as proof of
his forgiveness. The Tradesman learns for all time that his mere
cleverness may bring a demon to his side in the night, and that he
never made so good a bargain as when he has restored ill-gotten gains.
The aristocrat and warrior returns to his mountain, aware now that
magnanimity and courage are not impossible to quiet men living by
merchandise. The hunting-ground must make way now for the
cattle-breeder. The sword must yield before the balances.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the tribes which in primitive times had these
encounters, and taught each other this lesson, they were long since
reconciled. But the ghosts of Israel and Edom, of Barter and Plunder,
fought on through long tribal histories. Israel represented by the
archangel Michael, and Edom by dragon Sama&euml;l, waged their war. One
characteristic of the opposing power has been already considered.
Sama&euml;l embodied Edom as the genius of Strife. He was the especial
Accuser of Israel, their Antichrist, so to say, as Michael was their
Advocate. But the name &lsquo;Edom&rsquo; itself was retained as a kind
of personification of the barbaric military and lordly Devil. The
highwayman in epaulettes, the heroic spoiler, with his hairy hand which
Israel itself had imitated many a time in its gloves, were summed up as
&lsquo;Edom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This personification is the more important since it has
characterised the more serious idea of Satan which prevails in the
world. He is mainly a moral conception, and means the pride and pomp of
the world, its natural wildness and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb143" href="#v2pb143" name="v2pb143">143</a>]</span>ferocities, and
the glory of them. The Mussulman fable relates that when Allah created
man, and placed him in a garden, he called all the angels to worship
this crowning work of his hands. Iblis alone refused to worship Adam.
The very idea of a garden is hateful to the spirit of
Nomadism.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e10854src" href="#xd20e10854" name=
"xd20e10854src">1</a> Man the gardener receives no reverence from the
proud leader of the Seraphim. God said unto him (Iblis), What hindered
thee from worshipping Adam, since I commanded thee? He answered, I am

hast created him of clay (black mud). God said, Get thee down therefore
from paradise, for it is not fit that thou behave thyself proudly

</div>
<p>The earnestness and self-devotion of the northern pagans in their
resistance to Christianity impressed the finest minds in the Church
profoundly. Some of the Fathers even quoted the enthusiasm of those
whom they regarded as devotees of the Devil, to shame the apathy of
christians. The Church could show no martyr braver than Rand, down
whose throat St. Olaf made a viper creep, which gnawed through his
side; and Rand was an example of thousands. This gave many of the early
christians of the north a very serious view of the realm of Satan, and
of Satan himself as a great potentate. It was increased by their
discovery that the pagan kings&mdash;Satan&rsquo;s subjects&mdash;had
moral codes and law-courts, and energetically maintained justice. In
this way there grew up a more dignified idea of Hell. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb144" href="#v2pb144" name=
"v2pb144">144</a>]</span>grotesque imps receded before the array of
majestic devils, like Satan and Beelzebub; and these were invested with
a certain grandeur and barbaric pride. They were regarded as rival
monarchs who had refused to submit themselves to Jehovah, but they were
deemed worthy of heroic treatment. The traces of this sentiment found
in the ancient frescoes of Russia are of especial importance. Nothing
can exceed the grandeur of the Hierarchy of Hell as they appear in some
of these superb pictures. Satan is generally depicted with similar
dignity to the king of heaven, from whom he is divided by a
wall&rsquo;s depth, sometimes even resembling him in all but complexion
and hair (which is fire on Satan). There are frequent instances, as in
the accompanying figure (<a href="#v2fig04">4</a>), where, in careful
correspondence <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb145" href="#v2pb145"
name="v2pb145">145</a>]</span>with the attitude of Christ on the
Father&rsquo;s knees, Satan supports the betrayer of Christ. Beside the
king of Hell, seated in its Mouth, are personages of distinction, some
probably representing those poets and sages of Greece and Rome, the
prospect of whose damnation filled some of the first christian Fathers
with such delight.</p>
<p>In Spain, when a Bishop is about to baptize one of the European
Dukes of the Devil, he asks at the font what has become of his
ancestors, naming them&mdash;all heathen. &lsquo;They are all in
hell!&rsquo; replies the Bishop. &lsquo;Then there will I follow
them,&rsquo; returns the Chief, and thereafter by no persuasion can he
be induced to fare otherwise than to Hell. Gradually the Church made up
its mind to ally itself with this obstinate barbaric pride and
ambition. It was willing to give up anything whatever for a kingdom of
this world, and to worship any number of Princes of Darkness, if they
would give unto the Bishops such kingdoms, and the glory of them. They
induced Esau to be baptized by promise of their aid in his oppressions,
and free indulgences to all his passions; and then, by his help, they
were able to lay before weaker Esaus the christian
alternatives&mdash;Be baptized or burnt!</p>
<p>Not to have known how to conquer in bloodless victories the barbaric
Esaus of the world by a virtue more pure, a heroism more patient, than
theirs, and with that &lsquo;sweet reasonableness of Christ,&rsquo;
which is the latest epitaph on his tomb among the rich; not to have
recognised the true nobility of the Dukes, and purified their pride to
self-reverence, their passion to moral courage, their daring and
freedom to a self-reliance at once gentle and manly; this was no doubt
the necessary failure of a dogmatic and irrational system. But it is
this which has made the christian Israel more of an impostor than its
prototype, in every country to which it came steadily developing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb146" href="#v2pb146" name=
"v2pb146">146</a>]</span>to a hypocritical imitator of the Esau whose
birthright it stole by baptism. It speedily lost his magnanimity, but
never his sword, which however it contrived to make at once meaner and
more cruel by twisting it into thumbscrews and the like. For many
centuries its voice has been, in a thin phonographic way, the voice of
Jesus, but the hands are the hands of Esau with Sama&euml;l&rsquo;s
claw added. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb147" href="#v2pb147"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These words of the prophet Hosea (x. 1, 2) foreshadow
the devil which the devout Jahvist saw growing steadily to enormous
strength through all the history of Israel. The germ of this enemy may
be found in our chapter on Fate; one of its earliest developments is
indicated in the account already given of the partition between Jacob
and Esau, and the superstition to which that led of a ghostly
Antagonist, to whom a share had been irreversibly pledged. From the
principle thus adopted, there grew a host of demons whom it was
believed necessary to propitiate by offering them their share. A
divided universe had for its counterpart a divided loyalty in the heart
of the people. The growth of a belief in the supremacy of one God was
far from being a real monotheism; as a matter of fact no <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb148" href="#v2pb148" name=
"v2pb148">148</a>]</span>primitive race has been monotheistic. In 2
Kings xvii. it is stated as a belief of the Jews that some Assyrians
who had been imported into their territory (Samaria) were slain by
lions because they knew not &lsquo;the manner of the God of the
land.&rsquo; Spinoza noticed the indications given in this and other
narratives that the Jews believed that gods whose worship was
intolerable within their own boundaries were yet adapted to other
regions (Tractatus, ii.). With this state of mind it is not wonderful
that when the Jews found themselves in those alien regions they
apprehended that the gods of those countries might also employ lions on
such as knew not their manner, but adhered to the worship of Jehovah
too exclusively.</p>
<p>Among the Jews grew up a more spiritual class of minds, whose
feeling towards the mongrel worship around them was that of abhorrence;
but these had a very difficult cause to maintain. The popular
superstitions were firmly rooted in the fact that terrible evils
afflicted mankind, and in the further fact that these did not spare the
most pious. Nay, it had for a long time been a growing belief that the
bounties and afflictions of nature, instead of following the direction
promised by the patriarchs,&mdash;rewarding the pious, punishing the
wicked,&mdash;were distributed in a reverse way. Dives and Lazarus
seemed to have their respective lots before any future paradise was
devised for their equalisation&mdash;as indeed is natural, since Dives
attends to his business, while Lazarus is investing his powers in
Abraham&rsquo;s bosom. Out of this experience there came at last the
demand for a life beyond the grave, without whose redress the pious
began to deem themselves of all men the most miserable. But before this
heavenly future became a matter of common belief, there were theories
which prepared, the way for it. It was held by the devout that the
evils which afflicted the righteous were Jehovah&rsquo;s tests of their
loyalty to him, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb149" href=
"#v2pb149" name="v2pb149">149</a>]</span>that in the end such trials
would be repaid. And when observation, following the theory, showed
that they were not so repaid, it was said the righteousness had been
unreal, the devotee was punished for hidden wickedness. When continued
observation had proved that this theory too was false, and that piety
was not paid in external bounties, either to the good man or his
family, the solution of a future settlement was arrived at.</p>
<p>This simple process may be traced in various races, and in its
several phases.</p>
<p>The most impressive presentation of the experiences under which the
primitive secular theory of rewards and punishments perished, and that
of an adjustment beyond the grave arose, is found in the Book of Job.
The solution here reached&mdash;a future reward in this life&mdash;is
an impossible one for anything more than an exceptional case. But the
Book of Job displays how beautiful such an instance would be, showing
afflictions to be temporary and destined to be followed by
compensations largely outweighing them. It was a tremendous statement
of the question&mdash;If a man die, shall he live again? Jehovah
answered, &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; out of the whirlwind, and raised Job out of
the dust. But for the millions who never rose from the dust that voice
was heard announcing their resurrection from a trial that pressed them
even into the grave. It is remarkable that Job&rsquo;s expression of
faith that his Vindicator would appear on earth, should have become the
one text of the Old Testament which has been adapted by christians to
express faith in immortality. Job strongly disowns that faith.</p>

<p class="first">The scenery and details of this drama are such as must
have made an impression upon the mind of the ancient Jews beyond what
is now possible for any existing people. In the first place, the
locality was the land of Uz, which Jeremiah (Lam. iv. 21) points out as
part of Edom, the territory traditionally ruled over by the great
invisible Accuser of Israel, who had succeeded to the portion of Esau,
adversary of their founder, Jacob. Job was within the perilous bounds.
And yet here, where scape-goats were offered to deprecate Sama&euml;l,
and where in ordinary sacrifices some item entered for the
devil&rsquo;s share, Job refused to pay any honour to the Power of the
Place. He offered burnt-offerings alone for himself and his sons, these
being exclusively given to Jehovah.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e10970src" href="#xd20e10970" name="xd20e10970src">2</a> Even
after his children and his possessions were destroyed by this great
adversary, Job offered his sacrifice without even omitting the salt,
which was the Oriental seal of an inviolable compact between two, and
which so especially recalled and consecrated the covenant with
Jehovah.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e10973src" href="#xd20e10973" name=
"xd20e10973src">3</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb151" href=
"#v2pb151" name="v2pb151">151</a>]</span>Among his twenty thousand
animals, Azazel&rsquo;s animal, the goat, is not even named.
Job&rsquo;s distinction was an absolute and unprecedented singleness of
loyalty to Jehovah.</p>
<p>This loyalty of a disciple even in the enemy&rsquo;s country is made
the subject of a sort of boast by Jehovah when the Accuser enters.
Postponing for the moment consideration of the character and office of
this Satan, we may observe here that the trial which he challenges is
merely a test of the sincerity of Job&rsquo;s allegiance to Jehovah.
The Accuser claims that it is all given for value received. These
possessions are taken away.</p>
<p>This is but the framework around the philosophical poem in which all
theories of the world are personified in grand council.</p>
<p>First of all Job (the Troubled) asks&mdash;Why? Orthodoxy answers.
(Eliphaz was the son of Esau (Sama&euml;l), and his name here means
that he was the Accuser in disguise. He, &lsquo;God&rsquo;s
strength,&rsquo; stands for the Law. It affirms that God&rsquo;s ways
are just, and consequently afflictions imply previous sin.) Eliphaz
repeats the question put by the Accuser in heaven&mdash;&lsquo;Was not
thy fear of God thy hope?&rsquo; And he brings Job to the test of
prayer, in which he has so long trusted. Eliphaz rests on revelation;
he has had a vision; and if his revelation be not true, he challenges
Job to disprove it by calling on God to answer him, or else securing
the advocacy of some one of the heavenly host. Eliphaz says trouble
does not spring out of the dust. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb152"
href="#v2pb152" name="v2pb152">152</a>]</span></p>
<p>Job&rsquo;s reply is to man and God&mdash;Point out the error! Grant
my troubles are divine arrows, what have I done to thee, O watcher of
men! Am I a sea-monster&mdash;and we imagine Job looking at his wasted
limbs&mdash;that the Almighty must take precautions and send spies
against me?</p>
<p>Then follows Bildad the Shuhite,&mdash;that is the
&lsquo;contentious,&rsquo; one of the descendants of Keturah
(Abraham&rsquo;s concubine), traditionally supposed to be inimical to
the legitimate Abrahamic line, and at a later period identified as the
Turks. Bildad, with invective rather than argument, charges that
Job&rsquo;s children had been slain for their sins, and otherwise makes
a personal application of Eliphaz&rsquo;s theology.</p>
<p>Job declares that since God is so perfect, no man by such standard
could be proved just; that if he could prove himself just, the argument
would be settled by the stronger party in his own favour; and
therefore, liberated from all temptation to justify himself, he affirms
that the innocent and the guilty are dealt with much in the same way.
If it is a trial of strength between God and himself, he yields. If it
is a matter of reasoning, let the terrors be withdrawn, and he will
then be able to answer calmly. For the present, even if he were
righteous, he dare not lift up his head to so assert, while the rod is
upon him.</p>
<p>Zophar &lsquo;the impudent&rsquo; speaks. Here too, probably, is a
disguise: he is (says the LXX.) King of the Min&aelig;ans, that is the
Nomades, and his designation &lsquo;the Naamathite,&rsquo; of unknown
significance, bears a suspicious resemblance to Naamah, a mythologic
wife of Sama&euml;l and mother of several devils. Zophar is cynical. He
laughs at Job for even suggesting the notion of an argument between
himself and God, whose wisdom and ways are unsearchable. He (God) sees
man&rsquo;s iniquity even when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb153"
href="#v2pb153" name="v2pb153">153</a>]</span>it looks as if he did
not. He is deeper than hell. What can a man do but pray and acknowledge
his sinfulness?</p>
<p>But Job, even in his extremity, is healthy-hearted enough to laugh
too. He tells his three &lsquo;comforters&rsquo; that no doubt Wisdom
will die with them. Nevertheless, he has heard similar remarks before,
and he is not prepared to renounce his conscience and common-sense on
such grounds. And now, indeed, Job rises to a higher strain. He has
made up his mind that after what has come upon him, he cares not if
more be added, and challenges the universe to name his offence. So long
as his transgression is &lsquo;sealed up in a bag,&rsquo; he has a
right to consider it an invention.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11029src"
href="#xd20e11029" name="xd20e11029src">4</a></p>
<p>Temanite Orthodoxy is shocked at all this. Eliphaz declares that
Job&rsquo;s assertion that innocent and guilty suffer alike makes the
fear of God a vain thing, and discourages prayer. &lsquo;With us are
the aged and hoary-headed.&rsquo; (Job is a neologist.) Eliphaz paints
human nature in Calvinistic colours.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Behold, (God) putteth no trust in his ministering
spirits,</p>
<p class="line">And the heavens are not pure in his sight;</p>
<p class="line">Much less abominable and polluted man,</p>
<p class="line">Who drinketh iniquity as water!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The wise have related, and they got it from the
fathers to whom the land was given, and among whom no stranger was
allowed to bring his strange doctrines, that affliction is the sign and
punishment of wickedness.</p>
<p>Job merely says he has heard enough of this, and finds no wise man
among them. He acknowledges that such reproaches add to his sorrows. He
would rather contend with God than with them, if he could. But he sees
a slight indication of divine favour in the remarkable unwisdom of his
revilers, and their failure to prove their point. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb154" href="#v2pb154" name=
"v2pb154">154</a>]</span></p>
<p>Bildad draws a picture of what he considers would be the proper
environment of a wicked man, and it closely resembles the situation of
Job.</p>
<p>But Job reminds him that he, Bildad, is not God. It is God that has
brought him so low, but God has been satisfied with his flesh. He has
not yet uttered any complaint as to his conduct; and so he, Job,
believes that his vindicator will yet appear to confront his
accusers&mdash;the men who are so glib when his afflictor is
silent.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11053src" href="#xd20e11053" name=
"xd20e11053src">5</a></p>
<p>Zophar harps on the old string. Pretty much as some preachers go on
endlessly with their pictures of the terrors which haunted the
deathbeds of Voltaire and Paine, all the more because none are present
to relate the facts. Zophar recounts how men who seemed good, but were
not, were overtaken by asps and vipers and fires from heaven.</p>
<p>But Job, on the other hand, has a curious catalogue of examples in
which the notoriously wicked have lived in wealth and gaiety. And if it
be said God pays such off in their children, Job denies the justice of
that. It is the offender, and not his child, who ought to feel it. The
prosperous and the bitter in soul alike lie down in the dust at last,
the good and the evil; and Job is quite content to admit that he does
not understand it. One thing he does understand: &lsquo;Your
explanations are false.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Eliphaz insists on Job having a dogma. If the orthodox dogma is
not true, put something in its place! Why <i>are</i> you afflicted?
What is, <i>your</i> theory? Is it because God was afraid of your
greatness? It must be as we say, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb155"
href="#v2pb155" name="v2pb155">155</a>]</span>and you have been
defrauding and injuring people in secret.</p>
<p>Job, having repeated his ardent desire to meet God face to face as
to his innocence, says he can only conclude that what befalls him and
others is what is &lsquo;appointed&rsquo; for them. His terror indeed
arises from that: the good and the evil seem to be distributed without
reference to human conduct. How darkness conspires with the assassin!
If God were only a man, things might be different; but as it is,
&lsquo;what he desireth that he doeth,&rsquo; and &lsquo;who can turn
him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bildad falls back on his dogma of depravity. Man is a
&lsquo;worm,&rsquo; a &lsquo;reptile.&rsquo; Job finds that for a worm
Bildad is very familiar with the divine secrets. If man is morally so
weak he should be lowly in mind also. God by his spirit hath garnished
the heavens; his hand formed the &lsquo;crooked
serpent&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Lo! these are but the borders of his works;</p>
<p class="line">How faint the whisper we have heard of him!</p>
<p class="line">But the thunder of his power who can understand?</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Job takes up the position of the agnostic, and the
three &lsquo;Comforters&rsquo; are silenced. The argument has ended
where it had to end. Job then proceeds with sublime eloquence. A man
may lose all outward things, but no man or god can make him utter a
lie, or take from him his integrity, or his consciousness of it.
Friends may reproach him, but he can see that his own heart does not.
That one superiority to the wicked he can preserve. In reviewing his
arguments Job is careful to say that he does <i>not</i> maintain that
good and evil men are on an equality. For one thing, when the wicked
man is in trouble he cannot find resource in his innocence. &lsquo;Can
he delight himself in the Almighty?&rsquo; When such die, their widows
do not bewail them. Men do not befriend oppressors when they come
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb156" href="#v2pb156" name=
"v2pb156">156</a>]</span>to want. Men hiss them. And with guilt in
their heart they feel their sorrows to be the arrows of God, sent in
anger. In all the realms of nature, therefore, amid its powers,
splendours, and precious things, man cannot find the wisdom which
raises him above misfortune, but only in his inward loyalty to the
highest, and freedom from moral evil.</p>
<p>Then enters a fifth character, Elihu, whose plan is to mediate
between the old dogma and the new agnostic philosophy. He is Orthodoxy
rationalised. Elihu&rsquo;s name is suggestive of his ambiguity; it
seems to mean one whose &lsquo;<i>God</i> is <i>He</i>&rsquo; and he
comes from the tribe of Buz, whose Hebrew meaning might almost be
represented in that English word which, with an added <i>z</i>, would
best convey the windiness of his remarks. Buz was the son of Milkah,
the Moon, and his descendant so came fairly by his theologic
&lsquo;moonshine&rsquo; of the kind which Carlyle has so well described
in his account of Coleridgean casuistry. Elihu means to be fair to both
sides! Elihu sees some truth in both sides! Eclectic Elihu! Job is
perfectly right in thinking he had not done anything to merit his
sufferings, but he did not know what snares were around him, and how he
might have done something wicked but for his affliction. Moreover, God
ruins people now and then just to show how he can lift them up again.
Job ought to have taken this for granted, and then to have expressed it
in the old abject phraseology, saying, &lsquo;I have received
chastisement; I will offend no more! What I see not, teach thou
me!&rsquo; (A truly Elihuic or &lsquo;contemptible&rsquo; answer to
Job&rsquo;s sensible words, &lsquo;Why is light given to a man whose
way is hid?&rsquo; Why administer the rod which enlightens as to the
anger but not its cause, or as to the way of amend?) In fact the
casuistic Elihu casts no light whatever on the situation. He simply
overwhelms him with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb157" href=
"#v2pb157" name="v2pb157">157</a>]</span>metaphors and generalities
about the divine justice and mercy, meant to hide this new and
dangerous solution which Job had discovered&mdash;namely, that the old
dogmatic theories of evil were proved false by experience, and that a
good man amid sorrow should admit his ignorance, but never allow terror
to wring from him the voice of guilt, nor the attempt to propitiate
divine wrath.</p>
<p>When Jehovah appears on the scene, answering Job out of the
whirlwind, the tone is one of wrath, but the whole utterance is merely
an amplification of what Job had said&mdash;what we see and suffer are
but fringes of a Whole we cannot understand. The magnificence and
wonder of the universe celebrated in that voice of the whirlwind had to
be given the lame and impotent conclusion of Job &lsquo;abhorring
himself,&rsquo; and &lsquo;repenting in dust and ashes.&rsquo; The
conventional Cerberus must have his sop. But none the less does the
great heart of this poem reveal the soul that was not shaken or divided
in prosperity or adversity. The burnt-offering of his prosperous days,
symbol of a worship which refused to include the supposed powers of
mischief, was enjoined on Job&rsquo;s Comforters. They must bend to him
as nearer God than they. And in his high philosophy Job found what is
symbolised in the three daughters born to him: Jemima (the Dove, the
voice of the returning Spring); Kezia (Cassia, the sweet incense);
Kerenhappuch (the horn of beautiful colour, or decoration).</p>
<p>From the Jewish point of view this triumph of Job represented a
tremendous heresy. The idea that afflictions could befall a man without
any reference to his conduct, and consequently not to be influenced by
the normal rites and sacrifices, is one fatal to a priesthood. If evil
may be referred in one case to what is going on far away among gods in
obscurities of the universe, and to some purpose beyond the ken of all
sages, it may so be referred in all cases, and though burnt-offerings
may be resorted to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb158" href=
"#v2pb158" name="v2pb158">158</a>]</span>formally, they must cease when
their powerlessness is proved. Hence the Rabbins have taken the side of
Job&rsquo;s Comforters. They invented a legend that Job had been a
great magician in Egypt, and was one of those whose sorceries so long
prevented the escape of Israel. He was converted afterwards, but it is
hinted that his early wickedness required the retribution he suffered.
His name was to them the troubler troubled.</p>
<p>Heretical also was the theory that man could get along without any
Angelolatry or Demon-worship. Job in his singleness of service, fearing
God alone, defying the Seraphim and Cherubim from Sama&euml;l down to
do their worst, was a perilous figure. The priests got no part of any
burnt-offering. The sin-offering was of almost sumptuary importance.
Hence the rabbinical theory, already noticed, that it was through
neglect of these expiations to the God of Sin that the morally spotless
Job came under the power of his plagues.</p>
<p>But for precisely the same reasons the story of Job became
representative to the more spiritual class of minds of a genuine as
contrasted with a nominal monotheism, and the piety of the pure, the
undivided heart. Its meaning is so human that it is not necessary to
discuss the question of its connection with the story of
Hari&#347;chandra, or whether its accent was caught from or by the
legends of Zoroaster and of Buddha, who passed unscathed through the
ordeals of Ahriman and Mara. It was repeated in the encounters of the
infant Christ with Herod, and of the adult Christ with Satan. It was
repeated in the unswerving loyalty of the patient Griselda to her
husband. It is indeed the heroic theme of many races and ages, and it
everywhere points to a period when the virtues of endurance and
patience rose up to match the agonies which fear and weakness had tried
to propitiate,&mdash;when man first learned to suffer and be strong.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is nothing about the Satan of the Book of Job to
indicate him as a diabolical character. He appears as a respectable and
powerful personage among the sons of God who present themselves before
Jehovah, and his office is that of a public prosecutor. He goes to and
fro in the earth attending to his duties. He has received certificates
of character from A. Schultens, Herder, Eichorn, Dathe, Ilgen, who
proposed a new word for Satan in the prologue of Job, which would make
him a faithful but too suspicious servant of God.</p>
<p>Such indeed he was deemed originally; but it is easy to see how the
degradation of such a figure must have begun. There is often a clamour
in England for the creation of Public Prosecutors; yet no doubt there
is good ground for the hesitation which its judicial heads feel in
advising such a step. The experience of countries in which Prosecuting
Attorneys exist is not such as to prove the institution one of unmixed
advantage. It is not in human nature for an official person not to make
the most of the duty <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb160" href=
"#v2pb160" name="v2pb160">160</a>]</span>intrusted to him, and the
tendency is to raise the interest he specially represents above that of
justice itself. A defeated prosecutor feels a certain stigma upon his
reputation as much as a defeated advocate, and it is doubtful whether
it be safe that the fame of any man should be in the least identified
with personal success where justice is trying to strike a true balance.
The recent performances of certain attorneys in England and America
retained by Societies for the Suppression of Vice strikingly illustrate
the dangers here alluded to. The necessity that such salaried social
detectives should perpetually parade before the community as purifiers
of society induces them to get up unreal cases where real ones cannot
be easily discovered. Thus they become Accusers, and from this it is an
easy step to become Slanderers; nor is it a very difficult one which
may make them instigators of the vices they profess to suppress.</p>
<p>The first representations of Satan show him holding in his hand the
scales; but the latter show him trying slyly with hand or foot to press
down that side of the balance in which the evil deeds of a soul are
being weighed against the good. We need not try to track
arch&aelig;ologically this declension of a Prosecutor, by increasing
ardour in his office, through the stages of Accuser, Adversary,
Executioner, and at last Rival of the legitimate Rule, and tempter of
its subjects. The process is simple and familiar. I have before me a
little twopenny book,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11133src" href=
"#xd20e11133" name="xd20e11133src">1</a> which is said to have a vast
circulation, where one may trace the whole mental evolution of Satan.
The ancient Devil-worshipper who has reappeared with such power in
England tells us that he was the reputed son <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb161" href="#v2pb161" name=
"v2pb161">161</a>]</span>of a farmer, who had to support a wife and
eleven children on from 7s. to 9s. per week, and who sent him for a
short time to school. &lsquo;My schoolmistress reproved me for
something wrong, telling me that God Almighty took notice of
children&rsquo;s sins. This stuck to my conscience a great while; and
who this God Almighty could be I could not conjecture; and how he could
know my sins without asking my mother I could not conceive. At that
time there was a person named Godfrey, an exciseman, in the town, a man
of a stern and hard-favoured countenance, whom I took notice of for
having a stick covered with figures, and an ink-bottle hanging at the
button-hole of his coat. I imagined that man to be employed by God
Almighty to take notice and keep an account of children&rsquo;s sins;
and once I got into the market-house and watched him very narrowly, and
found that he was always in a hurry, by his walking so fast; and I
thought he had need to hurry, as he must have a deal to do to find out
all the sins of children!&rsquo; This terror caused the little
Huntington to say his prayers. &lsquo;Punishment for sin I found was to
be inflicted after death, therefore I hated the churchyard, and would
travel any distance round rather than drag my guilty conscience over
that enchanted spot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The child is father to the man. When Huntington, S.S., grew up, it
was to record for the thousands who listened to him as a prophet his
many encounters with the devil. The Satan he believes in is an exact
counterpart of the stern, hard-favoured exciseman whom he had regarded
as God&rsquo;s employ&eacute;. On one occasion he writes, &lsquo;Satan
began to tempt me violently that there was no God, but I reasoned
against the belief of that from my own experience of his dreadful
wrath, saying, How can I credit this suggestion, when (God&rsquo;s)
wrath is already <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb162" href="#v2pb162"
name="v2pb162">162</a>]</span>revealed in my heart, and every curse in
his book levelled at my head.&rsquo; (That seems his only evidence of
God&rsquo;s existence&mdash;his wrath!) &lsquo;The Devil answered that
the Bible was false, and only wrote by cunning men to puzzle and
deceive people. &lsquo;There is no God,&rsquo; said the adversary,
&lsquo;nor is the Bible true.&rsquo; ... I asked, &lsquo;Who, then,
made the world?&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;I did, and I made men
too.&rsquo; Satan, perceiving my rationality almost gone, followed me
up with another temptation; that as there was no God I must come back
to his work again, else when he had brought me to hell he would punish
me more than all the rest. I cried out, &lsquo;Oh, what will become of
me! what will become of me!&rsquo; He answered that there was no escape
but by praying to him; and that he would show me some lenity when he
took me to hell. I went and sat in my tool-house halting between two
opinions; whether I should petition Satan, or whether I should keep
praying to God, until I could ascertain the consequences. While I was
thinking of bending my knees to such a cursed being as Satan, an
uncommon fear of God sprung up in my heart to keep me from
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In other words, Mr. Huntington wavered between the petitions
&lsquo;Good Lord! Good Devil!&rsquo; The question whether it were more
moral, more holy, to worship the one than the other did not occur to
him. He only considers which is the strongest&mdash;which could do him
the most mischief&mdash;which, therefore, to fear the most; and when
Satan has almost convinced him in his own favour, he changes round to
God. Why? Not because of any superior goodness on God&rsquo;s part. He
says, &lsquo;An uncommon fear of God sprung up in my heart.&rsquo; The
greater terror won the day; that is to say, of two demons he yielded to
the stronger. Such an experience, though that of one living in our own
time, represents a phase in the development <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb163" href="#v2pb163" name=
"v2pb163">163</a>]</span>of the relation between God and Satan which
would have appeared primitive to an Assyrian two thousand years ago.
The ethical antagonism of the two was then much more clearly felt. But
this bit of contemporary superstition may bring before us the period
when Satan, from having been a Nemesis or Retributive Agent of the
divine law, had become a mere personal rival of his superior.</p>
<p>Satan, among the Jews, was at first a generic term for an adversary
lying in wait. It is probably the furtive suggestion at the root of
this Hebrew word which aided in its selection as the name for the
invisible adverse powers when they were especially distinguished. But
originally no special personage, much less any antagonist of Jehovah,
was signified by the word. Thus we read: &lsquo;And God&rsquo;s anger
was kindled because he (Balaam) went; and the angel of the Lord stood
in the way for a Satan against him.... And the ass saw the angel of the
Lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his
hand.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11148src" href="#xd20e11148"
name="xd20e11148src">2</a> The eyes of Balaam are presently opened, and
the angel says, &lsquo;I went out to be a Satan to thee because the way
is perverse before me.&rsquo; The Philistines fear to take David with
them to battle lest he should prove a Satan to them, that is, an
underhand enemy or traitor.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11153src" href=
"#xd20e11153" name="xd20e11153src">3</a> David called those who wished
to put Shimei to death Satans;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11158src"
href="#xd20e11158" name="xd20e11158src">4</a> but in this case the
epithet would have been more applicable to himself for affecting to
protect the honest man for whose murder he treacherously
provided.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11163src" href="#xd20e11163" name=
"xd20e11163src">5</a></p>
<p>That it was popularly used for adversary as distinct from evil
appears in Solomon&rsquo;s words, &lsquo;There is neither Satan nor
evil occurrent.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11170src" href=
"#xd20e11170" name="xd20e11170src">6</a> Yet it is in connection with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb164" href="#v2pb164" name=
"v2pb164">164</a>]</span>Solomon that we may note the entrance of some
of the materials for the mythology which afterwards invested the name
of Satan. It is said that, in anger at his idolatries, &lsquo;the Lord
stirred up a Satan unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the
king&rsquo;s seed in Edom.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11177src"
href="#xd20e11177" name="xd20e11177src">7</a> Hadad, &lsquo;the
Sharp,&rsquo; bore a name next to that of Esau himself for the redness
of his wrath, and, as we have seen in a former chapter, Edom was to the
Jews the land of &lsquo;bogeys.&rsquo; &lsquo;Another Satan,&rsquo;
whom the Lord &lsquo;stirred up,&rsquo; was the Devastator, Prince
Rezon, founder of the kingdom of Damascus, of whom it is said,
&lsquo;he was a Satan to Israel all the days of
Solomon.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11182src" href="#xd20e11182"
name="xd20e11182src">8</a> The human characteristics of supposed
&lsquo;Scourges of God&rsquo; easily pass away. The name that becomes
traditionally associated with calamities whose agents were
&lsquo;stirred up&rsquo; by the Almighty is not allowed the glory of
its desolations. The word &lsquo;Satan,&rsquo; twice used in this
chapter concerning Solomon&rsquo;s fall, probably gained here a long
step towards distinct personification as an eminent national enemy,
though there is no intimation of a power daring to oppose the will of
Jehovah. Nor, indeed, is there any such intimation anywhere in the
&lsquo;canonical&rsquo; books of the Old Testament. The writer of Psalm
cix., imprecating for his adversaries, says: &lsquo;Set thou a wicked
man over him; and let Satan stand at his right hand. When he shall be
judged, let him be condemned; and let his prayer become sin.&rsquo; In
this there is an indication of a special Satan, but he is supposed to
be an agent of Jehovah. In the catalogue of the curses invoked of the
Lord, we find the evils which were afterwards supposed to proceed only
from Satan. The only instance in the Old Testament in which there is
even a faint suggestion of hostility towards Satan on the part of
Jehovah is in Zechariah. Here we find the following remarkable
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb165" href="#v2pb165" name=
"v2pb165">165</a>]</span>words: &lsquo;And he showed me Joshua the high
priest standing before the angel of Jehovah, and the Satan standing at
his right hand to oppose him. And Jehovah said unto Satan, Jehovah
rebuke thee, O Satan; even Jehovah, that hath chosen Jerusalem, rebuke
thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire? Now Joshua was
clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel. And he
answered and spake to those that stood before him, saying, Take away
the filthy garments from him. And to him he said, Lo, I have caused
thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with goodly
raiment.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11193src" href="#xd20e11193"
name="xd20e11193src">9</a></p>
<p>Here we have a very fair study and sketch of that judicial trial of
the soul for which mainly the dogma of a resurrection after death was
invented. The doctrine of future rewards and punishments is not one
which a priesthood would invent or care for, so long as they possessed
unrestricted power to administer such in this life. It is when an alien
power steps in to supersede the priesthood&mdash;the Gallio too
indifferent whether ceremonial laws are carried out to permit the full
application of terrestrial cruelties&mdash;that the priest requires a
tribunal beyond the grave to execute his sentence. In this picture of
Zechariah we have this invisible Celestial Court. The Angel of Judgment
is in his seat. The Angel of Accusation is present to prosecute. A poor
filthy wretch appears for trial. What advocate can he command? Where is
Michael, the special advocate of Israel? He does not recognise one of
his clients in this poor Joshua in his rags. But lo! suddenly Jehovah
himself appears; reproves his own commissioned Accuser; declares Joshua
a brand plucked from the burning (Tophet); orders a change of raiment,
and, condoning his offences, takes him into his own service.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb166" href="#v2pb166" name=
"v2pb166">166</a>]</span>But in all this there is nothing to show
general antagonism between Jehovah and Satan, but the reverse.</p>
<p>When we look into the Book of Job we find a Satan sufficiently
different from any and all of those mentioned under that name in other
parts of the Old Testament to justify the belief that he has been
mainly adapted from the traditions of other regions. The plagues and
afflictions which in Psalm cix. are invoked from Jehovah, even while
Satan is mentioned as near, are in the Book of Job ascribed to Satan
himself. Jehovah only permits Satan to inflict them with a proviso
against total destruction. Satan is here named as a personality in a
way not known elsewhere in the Old Testament, unless it be in 1 Chron.
xxi. 1, where Satan (the article being in this single case absent) is
said to have &lsquo;stood up against Israel, and provoked David to
number Israel.&rsquo; But in this case the uniformity of the passage
with the others (excepting those in Job) is preserved by the same
incident being recorded in 2 Sam. xxiv. 1, &lsquo;The anger of Jehovah
was kindled against Israel, and he (Jehovah) moved David against them
to say, Go number Israel and Judah.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is clear that, in the Old Testament, it is in the Book of Job
alone that we find Satan as the powerful prince of an empire which is
distinct from that of Jehovah,&mdash;an empire of tempest, plague, and
fire,&mdash;though he presents himself before Jehovah, and awaits
permission to exert his power on a loyal subject of Jehovah. The
formality of a trial, so dear to the Semitic heart, is omitted in this
case. And these circumstances confirm the many other facts which prove
this drama to be largely of non-Semitic origin. It is tolerably clear
that the drama of Hari&#347;chandra in India and that of Job were both
developed from the Sanskrit legends mentioned in our chapter on
Visw&aacute;mitra; and it is certain that Aryan and Semitic
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb167" href="#v2pb167" name=
"v2pb167">167</a>]</span>elements are both represented in the figure of
Satan as he has passed into the theology of Christendom.</p>
<p>Nor indeed has Satan since his importation into Jewish literature in
this new aspect, much as the Rabbins have made of him, ever been
assigned the same character among that people that has been assigned
him in Christendom. He has never replaced Sama&euml;l as their
Archfiend. Rabbins have, indeed, in later times associated him with the
Serpent which seduced Eve in Eden; but the absence of any important
reference to that story in the New Testament is significant of the
slight place it had in the Jewish mind long after the belief in Satan
had become popular. In fact, that essentially Aryan myth little
accorded with the ideas of strife and immorality which the Jews had
gradually associated with Sama&euml;l. In the narrative, as it stands
in Genesis, it is by no means the Serpent that makes the worst
appearance. It is Jehovah, whose word&mdash;that death shall follow on
the day the apple is eaten&mdash;is falsified by the result; and while
the Serpent is seen telling the truth, and guiding man to knowledge,
Jehovah is represented as animated by jealousy or even fear of
man&rsquo;s attainments. All of which is natural enough in an extremely
primitive myth of a combat between rival gods, but by no means
possesses the moral accent of the time and conditions amid which
Jahvism certainly originated. It is in the same unmoral plane as the
contest of the Devas and Asuras for the Amrita, in Hindu mythology, a
contest of physical force and wits.</p>

<p>The real development of Satan among the Jews was from an accusing to
an opposing spirit, then to an agent of punishment&mdash;a hated
executioner. The fact that the figure here given (<a href=
"#v2fig05">Fig. 5</a>) was identified by one so familiar with Semitic
demonology as Calmet as a representation of him, is extremely
interesting. It was found among <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb168"
href="#v2pb168" name="v2pb168">168</a>]</span>representations of
Cherubim, and on the back of one somewhat like it is a formula of
invocation against demons. The countenance is of that severe beauty
which the Greeks ascribed to Nemesis. Nemesis has at her feet the wheel
and rudder, symbols of her power to overtake the evil-doer by land or
sea; the feet of this figure are winged for pursuit. He has four hands.
In one he bears the lamp which, like Lucifer, brings light on the deed
of darkness. As to others, he <span class="corr" id="xd20e11232" title=
"Source: anwers">answers</span> Baruch&rsquo;s description (Ep. 13, 14)
of the Babylonian god, &lsquo;He hath a sceptre in his hand like a man,
like a judge of the kingdom&mdash;he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb169" href="#v2pb169" name="v2pb169">169</a>]</span>hath in his
hand a sword and an axe.&rsquo; He bears nicely-graduated implements of
punishment, from the lash that scourges to the axe that slays; and his
retributive powers are supplemented by the scorpion tail. At his knees
are signets; whomsoever he seals are sealed. He has the terrible eyes
which were believed able to read on every forehead a catalogue of sins
invisible to mortals, a power that made women careful of their veils,
and gave meaning to the formula &lsquo;Get thee behind
me!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11237src" href="#xd20e11237"
name="xd20e11237src">10</a></p>
<p>Now this figure, which Calmet believed to be Satan, bears on its
reverse, &lsquo;The Everlasting Sun.&rsquo; He is a god made up of
Egyptian and Magian forms, the head-plumes belonging to the one, the
multiplied wings to the other. Matter (<i>Hist. Crit. de Gnost.</i>)
reproduces it, and says that &lsquo;it differs so much from all else of
the kind as to prove it the work of an impostor.&rsquo; But Professor
C. W. King has a (probably fifth century) gem in his collection
evidently a rude copy of this (reproduced in his
&lsquo;Gnostics,&rsquo; Pl. xi. 3), on the back of which is
&lsquo;Light of Lights;&rsquo; and, in a note which I have from him, he
says that it sufficiently proves Matter wrong, and that this form was
primitive. In one gem of Professor King&rsquo;s (Pl. v. 1) the lamp is
also carried, and means the &lsquo;Light of Lights.&rsquo; The
inscription beneath, within a coiled serpent, is in corrupt cuneiform
characters, long preserved by the Magi, though without understanding
them. There is little doubt, therefore, that the instinct of Calmet was
right, and that we have here an early form of the detective and
retributive Magian deity ultimately degraded to an accusing spirit, or
Satan.</p>
<p>Although the Jews did not identify Satan with their Scapegoat, yet
he has been veritably the Scapegoat among devils for two thousand
years. All the nightmares and phantasms that ever haunted the human
imagination <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb170" href="#v2pb170"
name="v2pb170">170</a>]</span>have been packed upon him unto this day,
when it is almost as common to hear his name in India and China as in
Europe and America. In thus passing round the world, he has caught the
varying features of many fossilised demons: he has been horned, hoofed,
reptilian, quadrupedal, anthropoid, anthropomorphic, beautiful, ugly,
male, female; the whites painted him black, and the blacks, with more
reason, painted him white. Thus has Satan been made a miracle of
incongruities. Yet through all these protean shapes there has persisted
the original characteristic mentioned. He is prosecutor and executioner
under the divine government, though his office has been debased by that
mental confusion which, in the East, abhors the burner of corpses, and,
in the West, regards the public hangman with contempt; the abhorrence,
in the case of Satan, being intensified by the supposition of an
overfondness for his work, carried to the extent of instigating the
offences which will bring him victims.</p>
<p>In a well-known English Roman Catholic book<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e11254src" href="#xd20e11254" name="xd20e11254src">11</a> of
recent times, there is this account of St. Francis&rsquo; visit to hell
in company with the Angel Gabriel:&mdash;&lsquo;St. Francis saw that,
on the other side of (a certain) soul, there was another devil to mock
at and reproach it. He said, Remember where you are, and where you will
be for ever; how short the sin was, how long the punishment. It is your
own fault; when you committed that mortal sin you knew how you would be
punished. What a good bargain you made to take the pains of eternity in
exchange for the sin of a day, an hour, a moment. You cry now for your
sin, but your crying comes too late. You liked bad company; you will
find bad company enough here. Your father was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb171" href="#v2pb171" name=
"v2pb171">171</a>]</span>a drunkard, look at him there drinking red-hot
fire. You were too idle to go to mass on Sundays; be as idle as you
like now, for there is no mass to go to. You disobeyed your father, but
you dare not disobey him who is your father in hell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This devil speaks as one carrying out the divine decrees. He
preaches. He utters from his chasuble of flame the sermons of Father
Furniss. And, no doubt, wherever belief in Satan is theological, this
is pretty much the form which he assumes before the mind (or what such
believers would call their mind, albeit really the mind of some Syrian
dead these two thousand years). But the Satan popularly personalised
was man&rsquo;s effort to imagine an enthusiasm of inhumanity. He is
the necessary appendage to a personalised Omnipotence, whose thoughts
are not as man&rsquo;s thoughts, but claim to coerce these. His
degradation reflects the heartlessness and the ingenuity of torture
which must always represent personal government with its catalogue of
fictitious crimes. Offences against mere Majesty, against iniquities
framed in law, must be doubly punished, the thing to be secured being
doubly weak. Under any theocratic government law and punishment would
become the types of diabolism. Satan thus has a twofold significance.
He reports what powerful priesthoods found to be the obstacles to their
authority; and he reports the character of the priestly despotisms
which aimed to obstruct human development. <span class=

Krishna&mdash;Emissaries of Kansa&mdash;Astyages and
Cyrus&mdash;Zoh&aacute;k&mdash;Bel and the Christian.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Jews had already, when Christ appeared, formed the
theory that the hardening of Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, and his resistance
to the departure of Israel from Egypt, were due to diabolical sorcery.
The belief afterwards matured; that Edom (Esau or Sama&euml;l) was the
instigator of Roman aggression was steadily forming. The mental
conditions were therefore favourable to the growth of a belief in the
Jewish followers of Christ that the hostility to the religious movement
of their time was another effort on the part of Sama&euml;l to crush
the kingdom of God. Herod was not, indeed, called Satan or Sama&euml;l,
nor was Pharaoh; but the splendour and grandeur of this Idumean (the
realm of Esau), notwithstanding his oppressions and crimes, had made
him a fair representative to the people of the supernatural power they
dreaded. Under these circumstances it was a powerful appeal to the
sympathies of the Jewish people to invent in connection with Herod a
myth exactly similar to that associated with Pharaoh,&mdash;namely, a
conspiracy with sorcerers, and consequent massacre of all new-born
children.</p>
<p>The myths which tell of divine babes supernaturally saved from royal
hostility are veritable myths, even <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb173" href="#v2pb173" name="v2pb173">173</a>]</span>where they
occur so late in time that historic names and places are given; for, of
course, it is impossible that by any natural means either Pharaoh or
Herod should be aware of the peculiar nature of any particular infant
born in their dominions. Such traditions, when thus presented in
historical guise, can only be explained by reference to corresponding
fables written out in simpler mythic form; while it is especially
necessary to remember that such corresponding narratives may be of
independent ethnical origin, and that the later in time may be more
primitive spiritually.</p>
<p>In the Legend of Zoroaster<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11279src"
href="#xd20e11279" name="xd20e11279src">1</a> his mother Dogdo,
previous to his birth, has a dream in which she sees a black cloud,
which, like the wing of some vast bird, hides the sun, and brings on
frightful darkness. This cloud rains down on her house terrible beasts
with sharp teeth,&mdash;tigers, lions, wolves, rhinoceroses, serpents.
One monster especially attacks her with great fury, and her unborn babe
speaks in reassuring terms. A great light rises and the beasts fall. A
beautiful youth appears, hurls a book at the Devas (Devils), and they
fly, with exception of three,&mdash;a wolf, a lion, and a tiger. These,
however, the youth drives away with a luminous horn. He then replaces
the holy infant in the womb, and says to the mother: &lsquo;Fear
nothing! The King of Heaven protects this infant. The earth waits for
him. He is the prophet whom Ormuzd sends to his people: his law will
fill the world with joy: he will make the lion and the lamb drink in
the same place. Fear not these ferocious beasts; why should he whom
Ormuzd preserves fear the enmity of the whole world?&rsquo; With these
words the youth vanished, and Dogdo awoke. Repairing to an interpreter,
she was told that the Horn meant the grandeur of Ormuzd; the Book was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb174" href="#v2pb174" name=
"v2pb174">174</a>]</span>the Avesta; the three Beasts betokened three
powerful enemies.</p>
<p>Zoroaster was born laughing. This prodigy being noised abroad, the
Magicians became alarmed, and sought to slay the child. One of them
raised a sword to strike him, but his arm fell to the ground. The
Magicians bore the child to the desert, kindled a fire and threw him
into it, but his mother afterwards found him sleeping tranquilly and
unharmed in the flames. Next he was thrown in front of a drove of cows
and bulls, but the fiercest of the bulls stood carefully over the child
and protected him. The Magicians killed all the young of a pack of
wolves, and then cast the infant Zoroaster to them that they might vent
their rage upon him, but the mouths of the wolves were shut. They
abandoned the child on a lonely mountain, but two ewes came and suckled
him.</p>
<p>Zoroaster&rsquo;s father respected the ministers of the Devas
(Magi), but his child rebuked him. Zoroaster walked on the water
(crossing a great river where was no bridge) on his way to Mount Iran
where he was to receive the Law. It was then he had the vision of the
battle between the two serpent armies,&mdash;the white and black
adders, the former, from the South, conquering the latter, which had
come from the North to destroy him.</p>
<p>The Legend of the Infant Krishna is as follows:&mdash;The tyrant
Kansa, having given his sister Devaki in marriage to Vasud&eacute;va,
as he was returning from the wedding heard a voice declare, &lsquo;The
eighth son of Devaki is destined to be thy destroyer.&rsquo; Alarmed at
this, Kansa cast his sister and her husband into a prison with seven
iron doors, and whenever a son was born he caused it to be instantly
destroyed. When Devaki became pregnant the eighth time, Brahma and
Siva, with attending Devas, appeared and sang: &lsquo;O favoured among
women! in thy delivery <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb175" href=
"#v2pb175" name="v2pb175">175</a>]</span>all nature shall have cause to
exult! How ardently we long to behold that face for the sake of which
we have coursed round three worlds!&rsquo; When Krishna was born a
chorus of celestial spirits saluted him; the room was illumined with
supernatural light. While Devaki was weeping at the fatal decree of
Kansa that her son should be destroyed, a voice was heard by
Vasud&eacute;va saying: &lsquo;Son of Yadu, carry this child to Gokul,
on the other side of the river Jumna, to Nauda, whose wife has just
given birth to a daughter. Leave him and bring the girl hither.&rsquo;
At this the seven doors swung open, deep sleep fell on the guards, and
Vasud&eacute;va went forth with the holy infant in his arms. The river
Jumna was swollen, but the waters, having kissed the feet of Krishna,
retired on either side, opening a pathway. The great serpent of Vishnu
held its hood over this new incarnation of its Lord. Beside sleeping
Nauda and his wife the daughter was replaced by the son, who was named
Krishna, the Dark.</p>
<p>When all this had happened a voice came to Kansa saying: &lsquo;The
boy destined to destroy thee is born, and is now living.&rsquo;
Whereupon Kansa ordered all the male children in his kingdom to be
destroyed. This being ineffectual, the whereabouts of Krishna were
discovered; but the messenger who was sent to destroy the child beheld
its image in the water and adored it. The Rakshasas worked in the
interest of Kansa. One approached the divine child in shape of a
monstrous bull whose head he wrung off; and he so burned in the stomach
of a crocodile which had swallowed him that the monster cast him from
his mouth unharmed.</p>
<p>Finally, as a youth, Krishna, after living some time as a herdsman,
attacked the tyrant Kansa, tore the crown from his head, and dragged
him by his hair a long way; with the curious result that Kansa became
liberated from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb176" href="#v2pb176"
name="v2pb176">176</a>]</span>the three worlds, such virtue had long
thinking about the incarnate one, even in enmity!</p>
<p>The divine beings represented in these legends find their complement
in the fabulous history of Cyrus; and the hostile powers which sought
their destruction are represented in demonology by the Persian
tyrant-devil Zoh&aacute;k. The name of Astyages, the grandfather of
Cyrus, has been satisfactorily traced to Ashdah&aacute;k, and Ajis
Dah&aacute;ka, the &lsquo;biting snake.&rsquo; The word thus connects
him with Vedic Ahi and with Iranian Zoh&aacute;k, the tyrant out of
whose shoulders a magician evoked two serpents which adhered to him and
became at once his familiars and the arms of his cruelty. As Astyages,
the last king of Media, he had a dream that the offspring of his
daughter Mandane would reign over Asia. He gave her in marriage to
Cambyses, and when she bore a child (Cyrus), committed it to his
minister Harpagus to be slain. Harpagus, however, moved with pity, gave
it to a herdsman of Astyages, who substituted for it a still-born
child, and having so satisfied the tyrant of its death, reared Cyrus as
his own son.</p>
<p>The luminous Horn of the Zoroastrian legend and the diabolism of
Zoh&aacute;k are both recalled in the Book of Daniel (viii.) in the
terrific struggle of the ram and the he-goat. The he-goat, ancient
symbol of hairy Esau, long idealised into the Invisible Foe of Israel,
had become associated also with Babylon and with Nimrod its founder,
the Semitic Zoh&aacute;k. But Bel, conqueror of the Dragon, was the
founder of Babylon, and to Jewish eyes the Dragon was his familiar; to
the Jews he represented the tyranny and idolatry of Nimrod, the two
serpents of Zoh&aacute;k. When Cyrus supplanted Astyages, this was the
idol he found the Babylonians worshipping until Daniel destroyed it.
And so, it would appear, came about the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb177" href="#v2pb177" name="v2pb177">177</a>]</span>fact that to
the Jews the power of Christendom came to be represented as the Reign
of Bel. One can hardly wonder at that. If ever there were cruelty and
oppression passing beyond the limit of mere human capacities, it has
been recorded in the tragical history of Jewish sufferings. The
disbeliever in pr&aelig;ternatural powers of evil can no less than
others recognise in this &lsquo;Bel and the Christian,&rsquo; which the
Jews substituted for &lsquo;Bel and the Dragon,&rsquo; the real
archfiend&mdash;Superstition, turning human hearts to stone when to
stony gods they sacrifice their own humanity and the welfare of
mankind. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb178" href="#v2pb178" name=

<p class="first">The Devil, having shown Jesus all the kingdoms of this
world, said, &lsquo;All this power will I give thee, and the glory of
them: for that is delivered unto me, and to whomsoever I will I give
it,&rsquo; The theory thus announced is as a vast formation underlying
many religions. As every religion begins as an ideal, it must find
itself in antagonism to the world at large; and since the social and
political world are themselves, so long as they last, the outcome of
nature, it is inevitable that in primitive times the earth should be
regarded as a Satanic realm, and the divine world pictured elsewhere. A
legitimate result of this conclusion is asceticism, and belief in the
wickedness of earthly enjoyments. To men of great intellectual powers,
generally accompanied as they are with keen susceptibilities of
enjoyment and strong sympathies, the renunciation of this world must be
as a living burial. To men who, amid the corruptions of the world, feel
within them the power to strike in with effect, or who, seeing
&lsquo;with how little wisdom the world is governed,&rsquo; are stirred
by the sense of power, the struggle against the temptation to lead in
the kingdoms of this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb179" href=
"#v2pb179" name="v2pb179">179</a>]</span>world is necessarily severe.
Thus simple is the sense of those temptations which make the almost
invariable ordeal of the traditional founders of religions. As in
earlier times the god won his spurs, so to say, by conquering some
monstrous beast, the saint or saviour must have overcome some potent
many-headed world, with gems for scales and double-tongue, coiling
round the earth, and thence, like Lilith&rsquo;s golden hair, round the
heart of all surrendered to its seductions.</p>
<p>It is remarkable to note the contrast between the visible and
invisible worlds which surrounded the spiritual pilgrimage of Sakya
Muni to Buddhahood or enlightenment. At his birth there is no trace of
political hostility: the cruel Kansa, Herod, Magicians seeking to
destroy, are replaced by the affectionate force of a king trying to
retain his son. The universal traditions reach their happy height in
the ecstatic gospels of the Siamese.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e11327src" href="#xd20e11327" name="xd20e11327src">1</a> The
universe was illumined; all jewels shown with unwonted lustre; the air
was full of music; all pain ceased; the blind saw, the deaf heard; the
birds paused in their flight; all trees and plants burst into bloom,
and lotus flowers appeared in every place. Not under the dominion of
Mara<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11330src" href="#xd20e11330" name=
"xd20e11330src">2</a> was this beautiful world. But by turning from all
its youth, health, and life, to think only of its decrepitude, illness,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb180" href="#v2pb180" name=
"v2pb180">180</a>]</span>death, the Prince Sakya Muni surrounded
himself with another world in which Mara had his share of power. I
condense here the accounts of his encounters with the Prince, who was
on his way to be a hermit.</p>
<p>When the Prince passed out at the palace gates, the king Mara,
knowing that the youth was passing beyond his evil power, determined to
prevent him. Descending from his abode and floating in the air, Mara
cried, &lsquo;Lord, thou art capable of such vast endurance, go not
forth to adopt a religious life, but return to thy kingdom, and in
seven days thou shalt become an emperor of the world, ruling over the
four great continents.&rsquo; &lsquo;Take heed, O Mara!&rsquo; replied
the Prince; &lsquo;I also know that in seven days I might gain
universal empire, but I have no desire for such possessions. I know
that the pursuit of religion is better than the empire of the world.
See how the world is moved, and quakes with praise of this my entry on
a religious life! I shall attain the glorious omniscience, and shall
teach the wheel of the law, that all teachable beings may free
themselves from transmigratory existence. You, thinking only of the
lusts of the flesh, would force me to leave all beings to wander
without guide into your power. Avaunt! get thee away far from
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mara withdrew, but only to watch for another opportunity. It came
when the Prince had reduced himself to emaciation and agony by the
severest austerities. Then Mara presented himself, and pretending
compassion, said, &lsquo;Beware, O grand Being! Your state is pitiable
to look on; you are attenuated beyond measure, and your skin, that was
of the colour of gold, is dark and discoloured. You are practising this
mortification in vain. I can see that you will not live through it.
You, who are a Grand Being, had better give up this course, for be
assured you will derive much more advantage from sacrifices of fire
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb181" href="#v2pb181" name=
"v2pb181">181</a>]</span>and flowers.&rsquo; Him the Grand Being
indignantly answered, &lsquo;Hearken, thou vile and wicked Mara! Thy
words suit not the time. Think not to deceive me, for I heed thee not.
Thou mayest mislead those who have no understanding, but I, who have
virtue, endurance, and intelligence, who know what is good and what is
evil, cannot be so misled. Thou, O Mara! hast eight generals. Thy first
is delight in the five lusts of the flesh, which are the pleasures of
appearance, sound, scent, flavour, and touch. Thy second general is
wrath, who takes the form of vexation, indignation, and desire to
injure. Thy third is concupiscence. Thy fourth is desire. Thy fifth is
impudence. Thy sixth is arrogance. Thy seventh is doubt. And thine
eighth is ingratitude. These are thy generals, who cannot be escaped by
those whose hearts are set on honour and wealth. But I know that he who
can contend with these thy generals shall escape beyond all sorrow, and
enjoy the most glorious happiness. Therefore I have not ceased to
practise mortification, knowing that even were I to die whilst thus
engaged, it would be a most excellent thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is added that Mara &lsquo;fled in confusion,&rsquo; but the next
incident seems to show that his suggestion was not unheeded; for
&lsquo;after he had departed,&rsquo; the Grand Being had his vision of
the three-stringed guitar&mdash;one string drawn too tightly, the
second too loosely, the third moderately&mdash;which last, somewhat in
defiance of orchestral ideas, alone gave sweet music, and taught him
that moderation was better than excess or laxity. By eating enough he
gained that pristine strength and beauty which offended the five
Brahmans so that they left him. The third and final effort of Mara
immediately preceded the Prince&rsquo;s attainment of the order of
Buddha under the Bo-tree. He now sent his three daughters, Raka (Love),
Aradi (Anger), Tanha (Desire). Beautifully bedecked they approached
him, and Raka said, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb182" href=
"#v2pb182" name="v2pb182">182</a>]</span>&lsquo;Lord, fearest thou not
death?&rsquo; But he drove her away. The two others also he drove away
as they had no charm of sufficient power to entice him. Then Mara
assembled his generals, and said, &lsquo;Listen, ye Maras, that know
not sorrow! Now shall I make war on the Prince, that man without equal.
I dare not attack him in face, but I will circumvent him by approaching
on the north side. Assume then all manner of shapes, and use your
mightiest powers, that he may flee in terror.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Having taken on fearful shapes, raising awful sounds, headed by Mara
himself, who had assumed immense size, and mounted his elephant
Girimaga, a thousand miles in height, they advanced; but they dare not
enter beneath the shade of the holy Bo-tree. They frightened away,
however, the Lord&rsquo;s guardian angels, and he was left alone. Then
seeing the army approaching from the north, he reflected, &lsquo;Long
have I devoted myself to a life of mortification, and now I am alone,
without a friend to aid me in this contest. Yet may I escape the Maras,
for the virtue of my transcendent merits will be my army.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Help me,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;ye thirty Barami! ye powers of
accumulated merit, ye powers of Almsgiving, Morality, Relinquishment,
Wisdom, Fortitude, Patience, Truth, Determination, Charity, and
Equanimity, help me in my fight with Mara!&rsquo; The Lord was seated
on his jewelled throne (the same that had been formed of the grass on
which he sat), and Mara with his army exhausted every resource of
terror&mdash;monstrous beasts, rain of missiles and burning ashes,
gales that blew down mountain peaks&mdash;to inspire him with fear; but
all in vain! Nay, the burning ashes were changed to flowers as they
fell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come down from thy throne,&rsquo; shouted the evil-formed
one; &lsquo;come down, or I will cut thine heart into atoms!&rsquo; The
Lord replied, &lsquo;This jewelled throne was created by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb183" href="#v2pb183" name=
"v2pb183">183</a>]</span>the power of my merits, for I am he who will
teach all men the remedy for death, who will redeem all beings, and set
them free from the sorrows of circling existence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mara then claimed that the throne belonged to himself, and had been
created by his own merits; and on this armed himself with the Chakkra,
the irresistible weapon of Indra, and Wheel of the Law. Yet Buddha
answered, &lsquo;By the thirty virtues of transcendent merits, and the
five alms, I have obtained the throne. Thou, in saying that this throne
was created by thy merits, tellest an untruth, for indeed there is no
throne for a sinful, horrible being such as thou art.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then furious Mara hurled the Chakkra, which clove mountains in its
course, but could not pass a canopy of flowers which rose over the
Lord&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>And now the great Being asked Mara for the witnesses of his acts of
merit by virtue of which he claimed the throne. In response,
Mara&rsquo;s generals all bore him witness. Then Mara challenged him,
&lsquo;Tell me now, where is the man that can bear witness for
thee?&rsquo; The Lord reflected, &lsquo;Truly here is no man to bear me
witness, but I will call on the earth itself, though it has neither
spirit nor understanding, and it shall be my witness.<span class="corr"
id="xd20e11366" title="Not in source">&rsquo;</span> Stretching forth
his hand, he thus invoked the earth: &lsquo;O holy Earth! I who have
attained the thirty powers of virtue, and performed the five great
alms, each time that I have performed a great act have not failed to
pour water on thee. Now that I have no other witness, I call upon thee
to give thy testimony!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The angel of the earth appeared in shape of a lovely woman, and
answered, &lsquo;O Being more excellent than angels or men! it is true
that, when you performed your great works, you ever poured water on my
hair.&rsquo; And with these words she wrung her long hair, and from it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb184" href="#v2pb184" name=
"v2pb184">184</a>]</span>issued a stream, a torrent, a flood, in which
Mara and his hosts were overturned, their insignia destroyed, and King
Mara put to flight, amid the loud rejoicings of angels.</p>
<p>Then the evil one and his generals were conquered not only in power
but in heart; and Mara, raising his thousand arms, paid reverence,
saying, &lsquo;Homage to the Lord, who has subdued his body even as a
charioteer breaks his horses to his use! The Lord will become the
omniscient Buddha, the Teacher of angels, and Brahmas, and Yakkhas
(demons), and men. He will confound all Maras, and rescue men from the
whirl of transmigration!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The menacing powers depicted as assailing Sakya Muni appear only
around the infancy of Zoroaster. The interview of the latter with
Ahriman hardly amounts to a severe trial, but still the accent of the
chief temptation both of Buddha and Christ is in it, namely, the
promise of worldly empire. It was on one of those midnight journeys
through Heaven and Hell that Zoroaster saw Ahriman, and delivered from
his power &lsquo;one who had done both good and evil.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e11377src" href="#xd20e11377" name=
"xd20e11377src">3</a> When Ahriman met Zoroaster&rsquo;s gaze, he
cried, &lsquo;Quit thou the pure law; cast it to the ground; thou wilt
then be in the world all that thou canst desire. Be not anxious about
thy end. At least, do not destroy my subjects, O pure Zoroaster, son of
Poroscharp, who art born of her thou hast borne!&rsquo; Zoroaster
answered, &lsquo;Wicked Majesty! it is for thee and thy worshippers
that Hell is prepared, but by the mercy of God I shall bury your work
with shame and ignominy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In the account of Matthew, Satan begins his temptation of Jesus in
the same way and amid similar circumstances to those we find in the
Siamese legends of Buddha. It occurs in a wilderness, and the appeal is
to hunger. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb185" href="#v2pb185"
name="v2pb185">185</a>]</span>temptation of Buddha, in which Mara
promises the empire of the world, is also repeated in the case of Satan
and Jesus (<a href="#v2fig06">Fig. 6</a>). The menaces, however, in
this case, are relegated to the infancy, and the lustful temptation is
absent altogether. Mark has an allusion to his being in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb186" href="#v2pb186" name=
"v2pb186">186</a>]</span>the wilderness forty days &lsquo;with the
beasts,&rsquo; which may mean that Satan &lsquo;drove&rsquo; him into a
region of danger to inspire fear. In Luke we have the remarkable claim
of Satan that the authority over the world has been delivered to
himself, and he gives it to whom he will; which Jesus does not deny, as
Buddha did the similar claim of Mara. As in the case of Buddha, the
temptation of Jesus ends his fasting; angels bring him food
(<span class="trans" title="di&#275;konoun ayt&#333;"><span class=
"Greek" lang=
"el">&delta;&iota;&eta;&kappa;&#8057;&nu;&omicron;&upsilon;&nu;
&#7936;&upsilon;&tau;&#8182;</span></span> probably means that), and
thenceforth he eats and drinks, to the scandal of the ascetics.</p>
<p>The essential addition in the case of Jesus is the notable
temptation to try and perform a crucial act. Satan quotes an accredited
messianic prophecy, and invites Jesus to test his claim to be the
predicted deliverer by casting himself from the pinnacle of the Temple,
and testing the promise that angels should protect the true Son of God.
Strauss,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11410src" href="#xd20e11410" name=
"xd20e11410src">4</a> as it appears to me, has not considered the
importance of this in connection with the general situation.
&lsquo;Assent,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;cannot be withheld from the canon
that, to be credible, the narrative must ascribe nothing to the devil
inconsistent with his established cunning. Now, the first temptation,
appealing to hunger, we grant, is not ill-conceived; if this were
ineffectual, the devil, as an artful tactician, should have had a yet
more alluring temptation at hand; but instead of this, we find him, in
Matthew, proposing to Jesus the neck-breaking feat of casting himself
down from the pinnacle of the Temple&mdash;a far less inviting miracle
than the metamorphosis of the stones. This proposition finding no
acceptance, there follows, as a crowning effort, a suggestion which,
whatever might be the bribe, every true Israelite would instantly
reject with abhorrence&mdash;to fall down and worship the devil.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb187" href="#v2pb187" name=
"v2pb187">187</a>]</span></p>
<p>Not so! The scapegoat was a perpetual act of worship to the Devil.
In this story of the temptation of Christ there enter some
characteristic elements of the temptation of Job.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e11418src" href="#xd20e11418" name="xd20e11418src">5</a> Uz in the
one case and the wilderness in the other mean morally the same, the
region ruled over by Azazel. In both cases the trial is under divine
direction. And the trial is in both cases to secure a division of
worship between the good and evil powers, which was so universal in the
East that it was the test of exceptional piety if one did not swerve
from an unmixed sacrifice. Jesus is apparently abandoned by the God in
whom he trusted; he is &lsquo;driven&rsquo; into a wilderness, and
there kept with the beasts and without food. The Devil alone comes to
him; exhibits his own miraculous power by bearing him through the air
to his own Mount Seir, and showing him the whole world in a moment of
time; and now says to him, as it were, &lsquo;Try your God! See if
<i>he</i> will even turn stones into bread to save his own son, to whom
I offer the kingdoms of the world!&rsquo; Then bearing him into the
&lsquo;holy hill&rsquo; of his own God&mdash;the pinnacle of the
Temple&mdash;says, &lsquo;Try now a leap, and see if <i>he</i> saves
from being dashed to pieces, even in his own precincts, his so trustful
devotee, whom I have borne aloft so safely! Which, then, has the
greater power to protect, enrich, advance you,&mdash;he who has left
you out here to starve, so that you dare not trust yourself to him, or
I? Fall down then and worship me as your God, and all the world is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb188" href="#v2pb188" name=
"v2pb188">188</a>]</span>yours! It is the world you are to reign over:
rule it in my name!</p>
<p>When St. Anthony is tempted by the Devil in the form of a lean monk,
it was easy to see that the hermit was troubled with a vision of his
own emaciation. When the Devil appears to Luther under guise of a holy
monk, it is an obvious explanation that he was impressed by a memory of
the holy brothers who still remained in the Church, and who, while they
implored his return, pointed out the strength and influence he had lost
by secession. Equally simple are the moral elements in the story of
Christ&rsquo;s temptation. While a member of John&rsquo;s ascetic
community, for which &lsquo;though he was rich he became poor,&rsquo;
hunger, and such anxiety about a living as victimises many a young
thinker now, must have assailed him. Later on his Devil meets him on
the Temple, quotes scripture, and warns him that his visionary God will
not raise him so high in the Church as the Prince of this World
can.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11431src" href="#xd20e11431" name=
"xd20e11431src">6</a> And finally, when dreams of a larger union,
including Jews and Gentiles, visited him, the power that might be
gained by connivance with universal idolatry would be reflected in the
offer of the kingdoms of the world in payment for the purity of his
aims and singleness of his worship.</p>
<p>That these trials of self-truthfulness and fidelity, occurring at
various phases of life, would be recognised, is certain. A youth of
high position, as Christ probably was,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e11436src" href="#xd20e11436" name="xd20e11436src">7</a> or even
one with that great power over the people which all concede, was, in a
worldly sense, &lsquo;throwing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb189"
href="#v2pb189" name="v2pb189">189</a>]</span>away his
prospects;&rsquo; and this voice, real in its time, would naturally be
conventionalised. It would put on the stock costume of devils and
angels; and among Jewish christians it would naturally be associated
with the forty-days&rsquo; fast of Moses (Exod. xxxiv. 28; Deut. ix.
9), and that of Elias (1 Kings xix. 8), and the forty-years&rsquo;
trial of Israel in the wilderness. Among Greek christians some traces
of the legend of Herakles in his seclusion as herdsman, or at the
cross-roads between Vice and Virtue, might enter; and it is not
impossible that some touches might be added from the Oriental myth
which invested Buddha.</p>
<p>However this may be, we may with certainty repair to the common
source of all such myths in the higher nature of man, and recognise the
power of a pure genius to overcome those temptations to a success
unworthy of itself. We may interpret all such legends with a clearness
proportioned to the sacrifices we have made for truth and ideal right;
and the endless perplexities of commentators and theologians about the
impossible outward details of the New Testament story are simple
confessions that the great spirit so tried is now made to label with
his name his own Tempter&mdash;namely, a Church grown powerful and
wealthy, which, as the Prince of this World, bribes the conscience and
tempts away the talent necessary to the progress of mankind.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A representation of the Temptation of St. Anthony
(marionettes), which I witnessed at Tours (1878), had several points of
significance. It was the medi&aelig;val &lsquo;Morality&rsquo; as
diminished by centuries, and conventionalised among those whom the
centuries mould in ways and for ends they know not. Amid a scenery of
grotesque devils, rudely copied from Callot, St. Anthony appeared, and
was tempted in a way that recalled the old pictures. There was the same
fair Temptress, in this case the wife of Satan, who warns her lord that
his ugly devils will be of no avail against Anthony, and that the whole
affair should be confided to her. She being repelled, the rest of the
performance consisted in the devils continually ringing the bell of the
hermitage, and finally setting fire to it. This conflagration was the
supreme torment of Anthony&mdash;and, sooth to say, it was a fairly
comfortable abode&mdash;who utters piteous prayers and is presently
comforted by an angel bringing him wreaths of evergreen. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb191" href="#v2pb191" name=
"v2pb191">191</a>]</span></p>
<p>The prayers of the saint and the response of the angel were meant to
be seriously taken; but their pathos was generally met with pardonable
laughter by the crowd in the booth. Yet there was a pathos about it
all, if only this, that the only temptations thought of for a saint
were a sound and quiet house and a mistress. The bell-noise alone
remained from the great picture of Spagnoletto at Siena, where the
unsheltered old man raises his deprecating hand against the disturber,
but not his eyes from the book he reads. In Spagnoletto&rsquo;s picture
there are five large books, pen, ink, and hour-glass; but there is
neither hermitage to be burnt nor female charms to be resisted.</p>
<p>But Spagnoletto, even in his time, was beholding the vision of
exceptional men in the past, whose hunger and thirst was for knowledge,
truth, and culture, and who sought these in solitude. Such men have so
long left the Church familiar to the French peasantry that any
representation of their temptations and trials would be out of place
among the marionettes. The bells which now disturb them are those that
sound from steeples.</p>
<p>Another picture loomed up before my eyes over the puppet performance
at Tours, that which for Bunyan frescoed the walls of Bedford Gaol.
There, too, the old demons, giants, and devils took on grave and vast
forms, and reflected the trials of the Great Hearts who withstood the
Popes and Pagans, the armed political Apollyons and the Giant Despairs,
who could make prisons the hermitages of men born to be saviours of the
people.</p>
<p>Such were the temptations that Milton knew; from his own heart came
the pigments with which he painted the trial of Christ in the
wilderness. &lsquo;Set women in his eye,&rsquo; said Belial:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Women, when nothing else, beguiled the heart</p>
<p class="line">Of wisest Solomon, and made him build,</p>

<p class="line xd20e3317">To whom quick answer Satan thus returned.</p>

</div>
<p class="first">The progressive ideas which Milton attributed to Satan
have not failed. That Celestial City which Bunyan found it so hard to
reach has now become a metropolis of wealth and fashion, and the trials
which once beset pilgrims toiling towards it are now transferred to
those who would pass beyond it to another city, seen from afar, with
temples of Reason and palaces of Justice.</p>
<p>The old phantasms have shrunk to puppets. The trials by personal
devils are relegated to the regions of insanity and disease. It is
everywhere a dance of puppets though on a cerebral stage. A lady well
known in Edinburgh related to me a terrible experience she had with the
devil. She had invited some of her relations to visit her for some
days; but these relatives were Unitarians, and, after they had gone,
having entered the room which they had occupied, she was seized by the
devil, thrown on the floor, and her back so strained that she had to
keep her bed for some time. This was to her &lsquo;the Unitarian
fiend&rsquo; of which the Wesleyan Hymn-Book sang so long; but even the
Wesleyans have now discarded the famous couplet, and there must be few
who would not recognise that the old lady at Edinburgh merely had a
tottering body representing a failing mind.</p>
<p>I have just read a book in which a lady in America relates her trial
by the devil. This lady, in her girlhood, was of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb193" href="#v2pb193" name=
"v2pb193">193</a>]</span>a christian family, but she married a rabbi
and was baptized into Judaism. After some years of happy life a
terrible compunction seized her; she imagined herself lost for ever;
she became ill. A christian (Baptist) minister and his wife were the
evil stars in her case, and with what terrors they surrounded the poor
Jewess may be gathered from the following extract.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She then left me&mdash;that dear friend left me alone to my
God, and to him I carried a lacerated and bleeding heart, and laid it
at the foot of the cross, as an atonement for the multiplied sins I had
committed, whether of ignorance or wilfulness; and how shall I proceed
to portray the heart-felt agonies of that night preceding my
deliverance from the shafts of Satan? Oh! this weight, this load of
sin, this burden so intolerable that it crushed me to the earth; for
this was a dark hour with me&mdash;the darkest; and I lay calm, to all
appearance, but with cold perspiration drenching me, nor could I close
my eyes; and these words again smote my ear, No redemption, no
redemption; and the tempter came, inviting me, with all his
blandishment and power, to follow him to his court of pleasure. My eyes
were open; I certainly saw him, dressed in the most phantastic shape.
This was no illusion; for he soon assumed the appearance of one of the
gay throng I had mingled with in former days, and beckoned me to
follow. I was awake, and seemed to lie on the brink of a chasm, and
spirits were dancing around me, and I made some slight outcry, and
those dear girls watching with me came to me, and looked at me. They
said I looked at them but could not speak, and they moistened my lips,
and said I was nearly gone; then I whispered, and they came and looked
at me again, but would not disturb me. It was well they did not; for
the power of God was over me, and angels were around me, and whispering
spirits near, and I whispered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb194"
href="#v2pb194" name="v2pb194">194</a>]</span>in sweet communion with
them, as they surrounded me, and, pointing to the throne of grace,
said, &lsquo;Behold!&rsquo; and I felt that the glory of God was about
to manifest itself; for a shout, as if a choir of angels had tuned
their golden harps, burst forth in, &lsquo;Glory to God on high,&rsquo;
and died away in softest strains of melody. I lifted up my eyes to
heaven, and there, so near as to be almost within my reach, the
brightest vision of our Lord and Saviour stood before me, enveloped
with a light, ethereal mist, so bright and yet transparent that his
divine figure could be seen distinctly, and my eyes were riveted upon
him; for this bright vision seemed to touch my bed, standing at the
foot, so near, and he stretched forth his left hand toward me, whilst
with the right one he pointed to the throne of grace, and a voice came,
saying, &lsquo;Blessed are they who can see God; arise, take up thy
cross and follow me; for though thy sins be as scarlet they shall be
white as wool.&rsquo; And with my eyes fixed on that bright vision, I
saw from the hand stretched toward me great drops of blood, as if from
each finger; for his blessed hand was spread open, as if in prayer, and
those drops fell distinctly, as if upon the earth; and a misty light
encircled me, and a voice again said, &lsquo;Take up <i>thy</i> cross
and follow me; for though thy sins be as scarlet they shall be white as
wool.&rsquo; And angels were all around me, and I saw the throne of
heaven. And, oh! the sweet calm that stole over my senses. It must have
been a foretaste of heavenly bliss. How long I lay after this beautiful
vision I know not; but when I opened my eyes it was early dawn, and I
felt so happy and well. My young friends pressed around my bedside, to
know how I felt, and I said, &lsquo;I am well and so happy.&rsquo; They
then said I was whispering with some one in my dreams all night. I told
them angels <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb195" href="#v2pb195"
name="v2pb195">195</a>]</span>were with me; that I was not asleep, and
I had sweet communion with them, and would soon be
well.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11526src" href="#xd20e11526"

<p>That is what the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness comes to when
dislocated from its time and place, and, with its gathered ages of
fable, is imported at last to be an engine of torture sprung on the
nerves of a devout woman. This Jewess was divorced from her husband by
her Christianity; her child died a victim to precocious piety; but what
were home and affection in ruins compared with salvation from that
frightful devil seen in her holy delirium?</p>
<p>History shows that it has always required unusual courage for a
human being to confront an enemy believed to be pr&aelig;ternatural.
This Jewess would probably have been able to face a tiger for the sake
of her husband, but not that fantastic devil. Not long ago an English
actor was criticised because, in playing Hamlet, he cowered with fear
on seeing the ghost, all his sinews and joints seeming to give way; but
to me he appeared then the perfect type of what mankind have always
been when believing themselves in the presence of pr&aelig;ternatural
powers. The limit of courage in human nature was passed when the foe
was one which no earthly power or weapon could reach.</p>
<p>In old times, nearly all the sorcerers and witches were women; and
it may have been, in some part, because woman had more real courage
than man unarmed. Sorcery and witchcraft were but the so-called pagan
rites in their last degradation, and women were the last to abandon the
declining religion, just as they are the last to leave the superstition
which has followed it. Their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb196"
href="#v2pb196" name="v2pb196">196</a>]</span>sentiment and affection
were intertwined with it, and the threats of eternal torture by devils
which frightened men from the old faith to the new were less powerful
to shake the faith of women. When pagan priests became christians,
priestesses remained, to become sorceresses. The new faith had
gradually to win the love of the sex too used to martyrdom on earth to
fear it much in hell. And now, again, when knowledge clears away the
old terrors, and many men are growing indifferent to all religion,
because no longer frightened by it, we may expect the churches to be
increasingly kept up by women alone, simply because they went into them
more by attraction of saintly ideals than fear of diabolical
menaces.</p>
<p>Thomas Carlyle has selected Luther&rsquo;s boldness in the presence
of what he believed the Devil to illustrate his valour. &lsquo;His
defiance of the &lsquo;Devils&rsquo; in Worms,&rsquo; says Carlyle,
&lsquo;was not a mere boast, as the like might be if spoken now. It was
a faith of Luther&rsquo;s that there were Devils, spiritual denizens of
the Pit, continually besetting men. Many times, in his writings, this
turns up; and a most small sneer has been grounded on it by some. In
the room of the Wartburg, where he sat translating the Bible, they
still show you a black spot on the wall; the strange memorial of one of
these conflicts. Luther sat translating one of the Psalms; he was worn
down with long labour, with sickness, abstinence from food; there rose
before him some hideous indefinable Image, which he took for the Evil
One, to forbid his work; Luther started up with fiend-defiance; flung
his inkstand at the spectre, and it disappeared! The spot still remains
there; a curious monument of several things. Any apothecary&rsquo;s
apprentice can now tell us what we are to think of this apparition, in
a scientific sense; but the man&rsquo;s heart that dare rise defiant,
face to face, against Hell itself, can give no <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb197" href="#v2pb197" name=
"v2pb197">197</a>]</span>higher proof of fearlessness. The thing he
will quail before exists not on this earth nor under it&mdash;fearless
enough! &lsquo;The Devil is aware,&rsquo; writes he on one occasion,
&lsquo;that this does not proceed out of fear in me. I have seen and
defied innumerable Devils. Duke George,&rsquo;&mdash;of Leipzig, a
great enemy of his,&mdash;&lsquo;Duke George is not equal to one
Devil,&rsquo; far short of a Devil! &lsquo;If I had business at
Leipzig, I would ride into Leipzig, though it rained Duke Georges for
nine days running.&rsquo; What a reservoir of Dukes to ride
into!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11541src" href="#xd20e11541"
name="xd20e11541src">3</a></p>
<p>Although Luther&rsquo;s courage certainly appears in this, it is
plain that his Devil was much humanised as compared with the fearful
phantoms of an earlier time. Nobody would ever have tried an inkstand
on the Gorgons, Furies, Lucifers of ancient belief. In Luther&rsquo;s
Bible the Devil is pictured as a monk&mdash;a lean monk, such as he
himself was only too likely to become if he continued his rebellion
against the Church (<a href="#v2fig17">Fig. 17</a>). It was against a
Devil liable to resistance by physical force that he hurled his
inkstand, and against whom he also hurled the contents of his inkstand
in those words which Richter said were half-battles.</p>
<p>Luther&rsquo;s Devil, in fact, represents one of the last phases in
the reduction of the Evil Power from a personified phantom with which
no man could cope, to that impersonal but all the more real moral
obstruction with which every man can cope&mdash;if only with an
inkstand. The horned monster with cowl, beads, and cross, is a mere
transparency, through which every brave heart may recognise the
practical power of wrong around him, the established error, disguised
as religion, which is able to tempt and threaten him.</p>
<p>The temptations with menace described&mdash;those which,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb198" href="#v2pb198" name=
"v2pb198">198</a>]</span>coming upon the weak nerves of women,
vanquished their reason and heart; that which, in a healthy man, raised
valour and power&mdash;may be taken as side-lights for a corresponding
experience in the life of a great man now living&mdash;Carlyle himself.
It was at a period of youth when, amid the lonely hills of Scotland, he
wandered out of harmony with the world in which he lived. Consecrated
by pious parents to the ministry, he had inwardly renounced every dogma
of the Church. With genius and culture for high work, the world
demanded of him low work. Friendless, alone, poor, he sat eating his
heart, probably with little else to eat. Every Scotch parson he met
unconsciously propounded to that youth the question whether he could
convert his heretical stone into bread, or precipitate himself from the
pinnacle of the Scotch Kirk without bruises? Then it was he roamed in
his mystical wilderness, until he found himself in the gayest capital
of the world, which, however, on him had little to bestow but a further
sense of loneliness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, when I look back, it was a strange isolation I then
lived in. The men and women around me, even speaking with me, were but
Figures; I had practically forgotten that they were alive, that they
were not merely automatic. In the midst of their crowded streets and
assemblages, I walked solitary; and (except as it was my own heart, not
another&rsquo;s, that I kept devouring) savage also, as is the tiger in
his jungle. Some comfort it would have been, could I, like a Faust,
have fancied myself tempted and tormented of a Devil; for a Hell, as I
imagine, without Life, though only diabolic Life, were more frightful:
but in our age of Downpulling and Disbelief, the very Devil has been
pulled down&mdash;you cannot so much as believe in a Devil. To me the
Universe was all void of Life, of Purpose, of Volition, even of
Hostility: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb199" href="#v2pb199" name=
"v2pb199">199</a>]</span>it was one huge, dead, immeasurable,
Steam-engine, rolling on, in its dead indifference, to grind me limb
from limb. Oh, the vast gloomy, solitary Golgotha, and Mill of Death!
Why was the Living banished thither, companionless, conscious? Why, if
there is no Devil; nay, unless the Devil is your God?&rsquo; ...</p>
<p>&lsquo;From suicide a certain aftershine of Christianity withheld
me.&rsquo; ...</p>
<p>&lsquo;So had it lasted, as in bitter, protracted Death-agony,
through long years. The heart within me, unvisited by any heavenly
dewdrop, was smouldering in sulphurous, slow-consuming fire. Almost
since earliest memory I had shed no tear; or once only when I,
murmuring half-audibly, recited Faust&rsquo;s Deathsong, that wild
<i lang="de">Selig der den er im Siegesglanze findet</i> (Happy whom
<i>he</i> finds in Battle&rsquo;s splendour), and thought that of this
last Friend even I was not forsaken, that Destiny itself could not doom
me not to die. Having no hope, neither had I any definite fear, were it
of Man or of Devil; nay, I often felt as if it might be solacing could
the Arch-Devil himself, though in Tartarean terrors, rise to me that I
might tell him a little of my mind. And yet, strangely enough, I lived
in a continual, indefinite, pining fear; tremulous, pusillanimous,
apprehensive of I knew not what; it seemed as if all things in the
Heavens above and the Earth beneath would hurt me; as if the Heavens
and the Earth were but boundless jaws of a devouring monster, wherein
I, palpitating, waited to be devoured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Full of such humour, and perhaps the miserablest man in the
whole French Capital or Suburbs, was I, one sultry Dogday, after much
perambulation, toiling along the dirty little <i>Rue Sainte Thomas de
l&rsquo;Enfer</i>, among civic rubbish enough, in a close atmosphere,
and over pavements hot as Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s Furnace; whereby
doubtless my spirits <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb200" href=
"#v2pb200" name="v2pb200">200</a>]</span>were little cheered; when all
at once there rose a Thought in me, and I asked myself, &lsquo;What
<i>art</i> thou afraid of? Wherefore, like a coward, dost thou for ever
pip and whimper, and go cowering and trembling? Despicable biped! what
is the sum-total of the worst that lies before thee? Death? Well,
Death; and say the pangs of Tophet too, and all that the Devil or Man
may, will, or can do against thee! Hast thou not a heart; canst thou
not suffer whatsoever it be; and, as a Child of Freedom, though
outcast, trample Tophet itself under thy feet, while it consumes thee!
Let it come, then; I will meet it and defy it!&rsquo; And as I so
thought, there rushed like a stream of fire over my whole soul; and I
shook base Fear away from me for ever. I was strong, of unknown
strength; a spirit, almost a god. Ever from that time the temper of my
misery was changed: not Fear or whining Sorrow was it, but Indignation
and grim fire-eyed Defiance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thus had the <span class="sc">Everlasting No</span> pealed
authoritatively through all the recesses of my Being, of my
<span class="sc">Me</span>; and then was it that my whole <span class=
"sc">Me</span> stood up, in native God-created majesty and with
emphasis recorded its Protest. Such a Protest, the most important
transaction in Life, may that same Indignation and Defiance, in a
psychological point of view, be fitly called. The Everlasting No had
said, &lsquo;Behold thou art fatherless, outcast, and the Universe is
mine (the Devil&rsquo;s);&rsquo; to which my whole Me now made answer,
&lsquo;<i>I</i> am not thine, but Free, and for ever hate
thee!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is from this hour that I incline to date my spiritual New
Birth, or Baphometic fire-baptism; perhaps I directly thereupon began
to be a Man.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11596src" href=
"#xd20e11596" name="xd20e11596src">4</a></p>
<p>Perhaps he who so uttered his <i>Apage Satana</i> did not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb201" href="#v2pb201" name=
"v2pb201">201</a>]</span>recognise amid what haunted Edom he wrestled
with his Phantom. Saint Louis, having invited the Carthusian monks to
Paris, assigned them a habitation in the Faubourg Saint-Jacques, near
the ancient chateau of Vauvert, a manor built by Robert (le Diable),
but for a long time then uninhabited, because infested by demons, which
had, perhaps, been false coiners. Fearful howls had been heard there,
and spectres seen, dragging chains; and, in particular, it was
frequented by a fearful green monster, serpent and man in one, with a
long white beard, wielding a huge club, with which he threatened all
who passed that way. This demon, in common belief, passed along the
road to and from the chateau in a fiery chariot, and twisted the neck
of every human being met on his way. He was called the Devil of
Vauvert. The Carthusians were not frightened by these stories, but
asked Louis to give them the Manor, which he did, with all its
dependencies. After that nothing more was heard of the Diable Vauvert
or his imps. It was but fair to the Demons who had assisted the friars
in obtaining a valuable property so cheaply that the street should
thenceforth bear the name of Rue d&rsquo;Enfer, as it does. But the
formidable genii of the place haunted it still, and, in the course of
time, the Carthusians proved that they could use with effect all the
terrors which the Devils had left behind them. They represented a great
money-coining Christendom with which free-thinking Michaels had to
contend, even to the day when, as we have just read, one of the bravest
of these there encountered his Vauvert devil and laid him low for
ever.</p>
<p>I well remember that wretched street of St. Thomas leading into Hell
Street, as if the Parisian authorities, remembering that Thomas was a
doubter, meant to remind the wayfarer that whoso doubteth is damned.
Near by is the convent of St. Michael, who makes no war <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb202" href="#v2pb202" name=
"v2pb202">202</a>]</span>on the neighbouring Rue Dragon. All
names&mdash;mere idle names! Among the thousands that crowd along them,
how many pause to note the quaintness of the names on the street-lamps,
remaining there from fossil fears and phantom battles long turned to
fairy lore. Yet amid them, on that sultry day, in one heart, was fought
and won a battle which summed up all their sense and value. Every Hell
was conquered then and there when Fear was conquered. There, when the
lower Self was cast down beneath the poised spear of a Free Mind, St.
Michael at last chained his dragon. There Luther&rsquo;s inkstand was
not only hurled, but hit its mark; there, &lsquo;Get thee behind
me,&rsquo; was said, and obeyed; there Buddha brought the archfiend
Mara to kneel at his feet.</p>
<p>And it was by sole might of a Man. Therefore may this be emphasised
as the temptation and triumph which have for us to-day the meaning of
all others.</p>
<p>A young man of intellectual power, seeing beyond all the
conventional errors around him, without means, feeling that ordinary
work, however honourable, would for him mean failure of his
life&mdash;because failure to contribute his larger truth to
mankind&mdash;he finds the terrible cost of his aim to be hunger, want,
a life passed amid suspicion and alienation, without sympathy, lonely,
unloved&mdash;and, alas! with a probability that all these losses may
involve loss of just what they are incurred for, the power to make good
his truth. After giving up love and joy, he may, after all, be unable
to give living service to his truth, but only a broken body and shed
blood. Similar trials in outer form have been encountered again and
again; not only in the great temptations and triumphs of sacred
tradition, but perhaps even more genuinely in the unknown lives of many
pious people all over the world, have hunger, want, suffering, been
conquered by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb203" href="#v2pb203"
name="v2pb203">203</a>]</span>faith. But rarely amid doubts. Rarely in
the way of Saint Thomas, in no fear of hell or devil, nor in any hope
of reward in heaven, or on earth; rarely indeed without any feeling of
a God taking notice, or belief in angels waiting near, have men or
women triumphed utterly over self. All history proves what man can
sacrifice on earth for an eternal weight of glory above. We know how
cheerfully men and women can sing at the stake, when they feel the fire
consuming them to be a chariot bearing them to heaven. We understand
the valour of Luther marching against his devils with his hymn,
&lsquo;<span lang="de">Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott.</span>&rsquo; But
it is important to know what man&rsquo;s high heart is capable of
without any of these encouragements or aids, what man&rsquo;s moral
force when he feels himself alone. For this must become an increasingly
momentous consideration.</p>
<p>Already the educated youth of our time have followed the wanderer of
threescore years ago into that St. Thomas d&rsquo;Enfer Street, which
may be morally translated as the point where man doubts every hell he
does not feel, and every creed he cannot prove. The old fears and hopes
are fading faster from the minds around us than from their professions.
There must be very few sane people now who are restrained by fear of
hell, or promises of future reward. What then controls human passion
and selfishness? For many, custom; for others, hereditary good nature
and good sense; for some, a sense of honour; for multitudes, the fear
of law and penalties. It is very difficult indeed, amid these complex
motives, to know how far simple human nature, acting at its best, is
capable of heroic endurance for truth, and of pure passion for the
right. This cannot be seen in those who intellectually reject the creed
of the majority, but conform to its standards and pursue its worldly
advantages. It must <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb204" href=
"#v2pb204" name="v2pb204">204</a>]</span>be seen, if at all, in those
who are radically severed from the conventional aims of the
world,&mdash;who seek not its wealth, nor its honours, decline its
proudest titles, defy its authority, share not its prospects for time
or eternity. It must be proved by those, the grandeur of whose aims can
change the splendours of Paris to a wilderness. These may show what
man, as man, is capable of, what may be his new birth, and the religion
of his simple manhood. What they think, say, and do is not prescribed
either by human or supernatural command; in them you do not see what
society thinks, or sects believe, or what the populace applaud. You see
the individual man building his moral edifice, as genuinely as birds
their nests, by law of his own moral constitution. It is a great thing
to know what those edifices are, for so at last every man will have to
build if he build at all. And if noble lives cannot be so lived, we may
be sure the career of the human race will be downhill henceforth. For
any unbiassed mind may judge whether the tendency of thought and power
lies toward or away from the old hopes and fears on which the regime of
the past was founded.</p>
<p>A great and wise Teacher of our time, who shared with Carlyle his
lonely pilgrimage, has admonished his generation of the temptations
brought by talent,&mdash;selfish use of it for ambitious ends on the
one hand, or withdrawal into fruitless solitude on the other; and I
cannot forbear closing this chapter with his admonition to his young
countrymen forty years ago.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11625src" href=
"#xd20e11625" name="xd20e11625src">5</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Public and private avarice makes the air we breathe thick and
fat. The scholar is decent, indolent, complacent. See already the
tragic consequence. The mind <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb205"
href="#v2pb205" name="v2pb205">205</a>]</span>of this country, taught
to aim at low objects, eats upon itself. There is no work for any but
the decorous and the complacent. Young men of the fairest promise, who
begin life upon our shores, inflated by the mountain winds, shined upon
by all the stars of God, find the earth below not in unison with
these,&mdash;but are hindered from action by the disgust which the
principles on which business is managed inspire and turn drudges, or
die of disgust,&mdash;some of them suicides. What is the remedy? They
did not yet see, and thousands of young men as hopeful, now crowding to
the barriers for the career, do not yet see, that if the single man
plant himself indomitably on his instincts, and there abide, the huge
world will come round to him. Patience&mdash;patience;&mdash;with the
shades of all the good and great for company; and for solace, the
perspective of your own infinite life; and for work, the study and the
communication of principles, the making those instincts prevalent, the
conversion of the world. Is it not the chief disgrace in the
world&mdash;not to be an unit; not to be reckoned one character; not to
yield that peculiar fruit which each man was created to bear,&mdash;but
to be reckoned in the gross, in the hundred, in the thousand of the
party, the section, to which we belong; and our opinion predicted
geographically, as the north or the south? Not so, brothers and
friends,&mdash;please God, ours shall not be so. We will walk on our
own feet; we will work with our own hands; we will speak our own
minds.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb206" href="#v2pb206"

<p class="first">In a Hindu myth, Dhrubo, an infant devotee, passed
much time in a jungle, surrounded by ferocious beasts, in devotional
exercises of such extraordinary merit that Vishnu erected a new heaven
for him as the reward of his piety. Vishnu even left his own happy
abode to superintend the construction of this special heaven. In Hebrew
mythology the favourite son, the chosen people, is called out of Egypt
to dwell in a new home, a promised land, not in heaven but on earth.
The idea common to the two is that of a contrast between a natural and
a celestial environment,&mdash;a jungle and beasts, bondage and
distress; a new heaven, a land flowing with milk and honey,&mdash;and
the correspondence with these of the elect child, Dhrubo or Israel.</p>
<p>The tendency of Christ&rsquo;s mind appears to have been rather in
the Aryan direction; he pointed his friends to a kingdom not of this
world, and to his Father&rsquo;s many mansions in heaven. But the
Hebrew faith in a messianic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb207"
href="#v2pb207" name="v2pb207">207</a>]</span>reign in this world was
too strong for his dream; a new earth was appended to the new heaven,
and became gradually paramount, but this new earth was represented only
by the small society of believers who made the body of Christ, the
members in which his blood flowed.</p>
<p>That great cauldron of confused superstitions and mysticisms which
the Roman Empire became after the overthrow of Jerusalem, formed a
thick scum which has passed under the vague name of Gnosticism. The
primitive notions of all races were contained in it, however, and they
gathered in the second and third centuries a certain consistency in the
system of the Ophites. In the beginning existed <i>Bythos</i> (the
Depth); his first emanation and consort is <i>Ennoia</i> (Thought);
their first daughter is <i>Pneuma</i> (Spirit), their second
<i>Sophia</i> (Wisdom). Sophia&rsquo;s emanations are two&mdash;one
perfect, Christos; the other imperfect, Sophia-Achamoth,&mdash;who
respectively guide all that proceed from God and all that proceed from
Matter. Sophia, unable to act directly upon anything so gross as Matter
or unordered as Chaos, employs her imperfect daughter Sophia-Achamoth
for that purpose. But she, finding delight in imparting life to inert
Matter, became ambitious of creating in the abyss a world for herself.
To this end she produced the Demiurgus Ildabaoth (otherwise Jehovah) to
be creator of the material world. After this Sophia-Achamoth shook off
Matter, in which she had become entangled; but Ildabaoth (&lsquo;son of
Darkness&rsquo;) proceeded to produce emanations corresponding to those
of Bythos in the upper universe. Among his creations was Man, but his
man was a soulless monster crawling on the ground. Sophia-Achamoth
managed to transfer to Man the small ray of divine light which
Ildabaoth had inherited from her. The &lsquo;primitive Man&rsquo;
became thus a divine being. Ildabaoth, now entirely evil, was enraged
at having <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb208" href="#v2pb208" name=
"v2pb208">208</a>]</span>produced a being who had become superior to
himself, and his envy took shape in a serpent-formed Satan,
<i>Ophiomorphos</i>. He is the concentration of all that is most base
in Matter, conjoined with a spiritual intelligence. Their anti-Judaism
led the Ophites to identify Ildabaoth as Jehovah, and this serpent-son
of his as Michael; they also called him Sama&euml;l. Ildabaoth then
also created the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms, with all
their evils. Resolving to confine man within his own lower domain, he
forbade him to eat of the Tree of Knowledge. To defeat his scheme,
which had all been evolved out of her own temporary fall,
Sophia-Achamoth sent her own genius, also in form of a serpent, Ophis,
to induce Man to transgress the tyrant&rsquo;s command. Eve supposing
Ophis the same as Ophiomorphos, regarded the prohibition against the
fruit as withdrawn and readily ate of it. Man thus became capable of
understanding heavenly mysteries, and Ildabaoth made haste to imprison
him in the dungeon of Matter. He also punished Ophis by making him eat
dust, and this heavenly serpent, contaminated by Matter, changed from
Man&rsquo;s friend to his foe. Sophia-Achamoth has always striven
against these two Serpents, who bind man to the body by corrupt
desires; she supplied mankind with divine light, through which they
became sensible of their nakedness&mdash;the misery of their condition.
Ildabaoth&rsquo;s seductive agents gained control over all the
offspring of Adam except Seth, type of the Spiritual Man.
Sophia-Achamoth moved Bythos to send down her perfect brother Christos
to aid the Spiritual Race of Seth. Christos descended through the seven
planetary regions, assuming <span class="corr" id="xd20e11668" title=
"Source: sucessively">successively</span> forms related to each, and
entered into the man Jesus at the moment of his baptism. Ildabaoth,
discovering him, stirred up the Jews to put him to death; but Christos
and Sophia, abandoning the material <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb209" href="#v2pb209" name="v2pb209">209</a>]</span>body of Jesus
on the cross, gave him one made of ether. Hence his mother and
disciples could not recognise him. He ascended to the Middle Space,
where he sits by the right hand of Ildabaoth, though unperceived by the
latter, and, putting forth efforts for purification of mankind
corresponding to those put forth by Ildabaoth for evil, he is
collecting all the Spiritual elements of the world into the kingdom
which is to overthrow that of the Enemy.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e11673src" href="#xd20e11673" name="xd20e11673src">1</a></p>
<p>Notwithstanding the animosity shown by the Ophites towards the Jews,
most of the elements in their system are plagiarised from the Jews.
According to ancient rabbinical traditions, Adam and Eve, by eating the
fruit of the lowest region, fell through the six regions to the seventh
and lowest; they were there brought under control of the previously
fallen Sama&euml;l, who defiled them with his spittle. Their nakedness
consisted in their having lost a natural protection of which only our
finger-nails are left; others say they lost a covering of
hair.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11678src" href="#xd20e11678" name=
"xd20e11678src">2</a> The Jews also from of old contended that Seth was
the son of Adam, in whom returned the divine nature with which man was
originally endowed. We have, indeed, only to identify Ildabaoth with
Elohim instead of Jehovah to perceive that the Ophites were following
Jewish precedents in attributing the natural world to a fiend. The link
between, the two conceptions may be discovered in the writings of
Paul.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s pessimistic conception of this world and of human
nature was radical, and it mainly formed the mould in which dogmatic
Christianity subsequently took <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb210"
href="#v2pb210" name="v2pb210">210</a>]</span>shape. His general
theology is a travesty of the creation of the world and of man. All
that work of Elohim was, by implication, natural, that is to say,
diabolical. The earth as then created belonged to the Prince of this
world, who was the author of sin, and its consequence, death. In Adam
all die. The natural man is enmity against God; he is of the earth
earthy; his father is the devil; he cannot know spiritual things. All
mankind are born spiritually dead. Christ is a new and diviner
Demiurgos, engaged in the work of producing a new creation and a new
man. For his purpose the old law, circumcision or uncircumcision, are
of no avail or importance, but a new creature. His death is the symbol
of man&rsquo;s death to the natural world, his resurrection of
man&rsquo;s rising into a new world which mere flesh and blood cannot
inherit. As God breathed into Adam&rsquo;s nostrils the breath of life,
the Spirit breathes upon the elect of Christ a new mind and new
heart.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;new creature&rsquo; must inhale an entirely new physical
atmosphere. When Paul speaks of &lsquo;the Prince of the Power of the
Air,&rsquo; it must not be supposed that he is only metaphorical. On
this, however, we must dwell for a little.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The air,&rsquo; writes Burton in his &lsquo;Anatomy of
Melancholy,&rsquo; &lsquo;The air is not so full of flies in summer as
it is at all times of invisible devils. They counterfeit suns and
moons, and sit on ships&rsquo; masts. They cause whirlwinds of a
sudden, and tempestuous storms, which though our meteorologists
generally refer to natural causes, yet I am of Bodine&rsquo;s mind,
they are more often caused by those aerial devils in their several
quarters. Cardan gives much information concerning them. His father had
one of them, an aerial devil, bound to him for eight and twenty years;
as Agrippa&rsquo;s dog had a devil tied to his collar. Some think that
Paracelsus had one confined in his sword pommel. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb211" href="#v2pb211" name=
"v2pb211">211</a>]</span>Others wear them in rings;&rsquo; and so the
old man runs on, speculating about the mysterious cobwebs collected in
the ceiling of his brain.</p>
<p>The atmosphere mentally breathed by Burton and his authorities was
indeed charged with invisible phantasms; and every one of them was in
its origin a genuine intellectual effort to interpret the phenomena of
nature. It is not wonderful that the ancients should have ascribed to a
diabolical source the subtle deaths that struck at them from the air. A
single breath of the invisible poison of the air might lay low the
strongest. Even after man had come to understand his visible foes, the
deadly animal or plant, he could only cower and pray before the lurking
power of miasma and infection, the power of the air. The Tyndalls of a
primitive time studied dust and disease, and called the winged seeds of
decay and death &lsquo;aerial devils,&rsquo; and prepared the way for
Mephistopheles (devil of <i>smells</i>), as he in turn for the
<i>bacterial</i> demon of modern science.</p>
<p>There were not wanting theologic explanations why these malignant
beings should find their dwelling-place in the air. They had been
driven out of heaven. The etherial realm above the air was reserved for
the good. Of the demons the Hindus say, &lsquo;Their feet touch not the
ground.&rsquo; &lsquo;What man of virtue is there,&rsquo; said Titus to
his soldiers, &lsquo;who does not know that those souls which are
severed from their fleshy bodies in battles by the sword are received
by the &aelig;ther&mdash;that purest of elements&mdash;and joined to
that company which are placed among the stars; that they become gods,
d&aelig;mons, and propitious heroes, and show themselves as such to
their posterity afterwards?&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11702src"
href="#xd20e11702" name="xd20e11702src">3</a> Malignant spirits were
believed to hold a more undisputed sway over the atmosphere than over
the earth, although <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb212" href=
"#v2pb212" name="v2pb212">212</a>]</span>our planet was mainly in their
power, and the subjects of the higher empire always a small
colony.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11707src" href="#xd20e11707" name=
"xd20e11707src">4</a> Moreover, there was a natural tendency of demons,
which originally represented earthly evils, when these were conquered
by human intelligence, to pass into the realm least accessible to
science or to control by man. The uncharted winds became their
refuge.</p>
<p>This belief was general among the Christian Fathers,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e11712src" href="#xd20e11712" name=
"xd20e11712src">5</a> lasted a very long time even among the educated,
and is still the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, as any one may
see by reading the authorised work of Mgr. Gaume on &lsquo;Holy
Water&rsquo; (p. 305). So long as it was admitted among thinking people
that the mind was as competent to build facts upon theory as theories
on fact, a great deal might be plausibly said for this atmospheric
diabolarchy. In the days when witchcraft was first called in question,
Glanvil argued &lsquo;that since this little Spot is so thickly peopled
in every Atome of it, &rsquo;tis weakness to think that all the vast
spaces Above and hollows under Ground are desert and
uninhabited,&rsquo; and he anticipated that, as microscopic science
might reveal further populations in places seemingly vacant, it would
necessitate the belief that the regions of the upper air are
inhabited.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11715src" href="#xd20e11715"
name="xd20e11715src">6</a> Other learned men concluded that the spirits
that lodge there are such as are clogged with earthly elements; the
baser sort; dwelling in cold air, they would like to inhabit the more
sheltered earth. In repayment for broth, and various dietetic horrors
proffered them by witches, they enable them to pass freely through
their realm&mdash;the air. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb213" href=
"#v2pb213" name="v2pb213">213</a>]</span></p>
<p>Out of such intellectual atmosphere came Paul&rsquo;s sentence (Eph.
ii. 2) about &lsquo;the Prince of the Power of the Air.&rsquo; It was a
spiritualisation of the existing aerial demonology. When Paul and his
companions carried their religious agitation into the centres of
learning and wealth, and brought the teachings of a Jew to confront the
temples of Greece and Rome, they found themselves unrelated to that
great world. It had another habit of mind and feeling, and the idea
grew in him that it was the spirits of the Satanic world counteracting
the spirit sent on earth from the divine world. This animated its
fashions, philosophy, science, and literature. He warns the Church at
Ephesus that they will need the whole armour of God, because they are
wrestling not with mere flesh and blood, but against the rulers of the
world&rsquo;s darkness, the evil spirits in high places&mdash;that is,
in the Air.</p>

<p>As heirs of this new nature and new world, with its new atmosphere,
purchased and endowed by Christ, the Pauline theory further
presupposes, that the natural man, having died, is buried with Christ
in baptism, rises with him, and is then sealed to him by the Holy
Ghost. For a little time such must still bear about them their fleshy
bodies, but soon Christ shall come, and these vile bodies shall be
changed into his likeness; meanwhile they must keep their bodies in
subjection, even as Paul did, by beating it black and blue
(<span class="trans" title="hyp&#333;piaz&#333;"><span class="Greek"
lang=
"el">&#8017;&pi;&omega;&pi;&iota;&#8049;&zeta;&omega;</span></span>),
and await their deliverance from the body of the dead world they have
left, but which so far is permitted to adhere to them. This conception
had to work itself out in myths and dogmas of which Paul knew nothing.
&lsquo;If any man come after me and hate not his father and mother, and
his own (natural) life also, he cannot be my disciple.&rsquo; The new
race with which the new creation was in travail was logically
discovered to need a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb214" href=
"#v2pb214" name="v2pb214">214</a>]</span>new Mother as well as a new
Father. Every natural mother was subjected to a stain that it might be
affirmed that only one mother was immaculate&mdash;she whose conception
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb215" href="#v2pb215" name=
"v2pb215">215</a>]</span>was supernatural, not of the flesh. Marriage
became an indulgence to sin (whose purchase-money survives still in the
marriage-fee). The monastery and the nunnery represented this new
ascetic kingdom; that perilous word &lsquo;worldliness&rsquo; was
transmitted to be the source of insanity and hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Happily, the common sense and sentiment of mankind have so steadily
and successfully won back the outlawed interests of life and the world,
that it requires some research into ecclesiastical arch&aelig;ology to
comprehend the original significance of the symbols in which it
survives. The ancient rabbins limited the number of souls which hang on
Adam to 600,000, but the Christian theologians extended the figures to
include the human race. Probably even some orthodox people may be
scandalised at the idea of the fathers (Iren&aelig;us, for example),
that, at the Fall, the human race became Satan&rsquo;s rightful
property, did they see it in the picture copied by Buslaef, from an
ancient Russian Bible, in possession of Count Uvarof. Adam gives Satan
a written contract for himself and his descendants (<a href=
"#v2fig07">Fig. 7</a>). And yet, according to a recent statement, the
Rev. Mr. Simeon recently preached a sermon in the Church of St.
Augustine, Kilburn, London, &lsquo;to prove that the ruler of the world
is the devil. He stated that the Creator of the world had given the
control of the world to one of his chief angels, Lucifer, who, however,
had gone to grief, and done his utmost to ruin the world. Since then
the Creator and Lucifer had been continually striving to checkmate each
other. As Lucifer is still the Prince of this world, it would seem that
it is not he who has been beaten yet.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e11750src" href="#xd20e11750" name="xd20e11750src">7</a> A popular
preacher in America, Rev. Dr. Talmage, states the case as
follows:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb216" href="#v2pb216"
name="v2pb216">216</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;I turn to the same old book, and I find out that the Son of
Mary, who was the Son of God, the darling of heaven, the champion of
the ages, by some called Lord, by some called Jesus, by others called
Christ, but this morning by us called by the three blessed titles, Lord
Jesus Christ, by one magnificent stroke made it possible for us all to
be saved. He not only told us that there was a hell, but he went into
it. He walked down the fiery steeps. He stepped off the bottom rung of
the long ladder of despair. He descended into hell. He put his bare
foot on the hottest coal of the fiercest furnace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He explored the darkest den of eternal midnight, and then He
came forth lacerated and scarified, and bleeding and mauled by the
hands of infernal excruciation, to cry out to all the ages, &lsquo;I
have paid the price for all those who would make me their substitute.
By my piled-up groans, by my omnipotent agony, I demand the rescue of
all those who will give up sin and trust in me,&rsquo; Mercy! mercy!
mercy! But how am I to get it? Cheap. It will not cost you as much as a
loaf of bread. Only a penny? No, no. Escape from hell, and all the
harps, and mansions, and thrones, and sunlit fields of heaven besides
in the bargain, &lsquo;without money, and without
price.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>These preachers are only stating with creditable candour the
original significance of the sacraments and ceremonies which were the
physiognomy of that theory of &lsquo;a new creature.&rsquo; Following
various ancient traditions, that life was produced out of water, that
water escaped the primal curse on nature, that devils hate and fear it
because of this and the saltness of so much of it, many religions have
used water for purification and exorcism.<a class="noteref" id=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb217" href="#v2pb217" name=
"v2pb217">217</a>]</span>is based on the notion that every child is
offspring of the Devil, and possessed of his demon; the Fathers agreed
that all unbaptized babes, even the still-born, are lost; and up to the
year 1550 every infant was subjected at baptism to the exorcism,
&lsquo;I command thee, unclean spirit, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb218" href="#v2pb218" name="v2pb218">218</a>]</span>in the name of
the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, that thou come out, and
depart from, these infants whom our Lord Jesus Christ has vouchsafed to
call to his holy baptism, to be made members of his body and of his
holy congregation,&rsquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>A clergyman informed me that he knew of a case in which a man,
receiving back his child after christening, kissed it, and said,
&lsquo;I never kissed it before, because I knew it was not a child of
God; but now that it is, I love it dearly.&rsquo; But why not? Some
even now teach that a white angel follows the baptized, a black demon
the unbaptized.</p>
<p>The belief was wide-spread that unbaptized children were turned into
elves at death. In Iceland it is still told as a bit of folk-lore, that
when God visited Eve, she kept a large number of her children out of
sight, &lsquo;because they had not been washed,&rsquo; and these
children were turned into elves, and became the progenitors of that
uncanny race. The Greek Church made so much of baptism, that there has
been developed an Eastern sect which claims John the Baptist as its
founder, making little of Christ, who baptized none; and to this day in
Russia the peasant regards it as almost essential to a right reception
of the benedictions of Sunday to have been under water on the previous
day&mdash;soap being sagaciously added. The Roman Catholic Church,
following the provision of the Council of Carthage, still sets a high
value on baptismal exorcism; and Calvin refers to a theological debate
at the Sorbonne in Paris, whether it would not be justifiable for a
priest to throw a child into a well rather than have it die unbaptized.
Luther preserved the Catholic form of exorcism; and, in some districts
of Germany, Protestants have still such faith in it, that, when either
a child or a domestic animal is suspected of being possessed, they will
send for the Romish priest to perform the rite of exorcism.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb219" href="#v2pb219" name=

<p>Mr. Herbert Spencer has described the class of superstitions out of
which the sacrament of the Eucharist has grown. &lsquo;In some
cases,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;parts of the dead are swallowed by the
living, who seek thus to inspire themselves with the good qualities of
the dead; and we saw (&sect; 133) that the dead are supposed to be
honoured by this act. The implied notion was supposed to be associated
with the further notion that the nature of another being, inhering in
all the fragments of his body, inheres too in the unconsumed part of
anything consumed with his body; so that an operation wrought on the
remnants of his food becomes an operation wrought on the food
swallowed, and therefore on the swallower. Yet another implication is,
that between those who swallow different parts of the same food some
community of nature is established. Hence such beliefs as that ascribed
by Bastian to some negroes, who think that, &lsquo;on eating and
drinking consecrated food, they eat and drink the god
himself&rsquo;&mdash;such god being an ancestor, who has taken his
share. Various ceremonies among savages are prompted by this
conception; as, for instance, the choosing a totem. Among the Mosquito
Indians, &lsquo;the manner of obtaining this guardian was to proceed to
some secluded spot and offer up a sacrifice: with the beast or bird
which thereupon appeared, in dream or in reality, a compact for life
was made, by drawing blood from various parts of the body.&rsquo; This
blood, supposed to be taken by the chosen animal, connected the two,
and the animal&rsquo;s life became so bound up with their own that the
death of one involved that of the other.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e11786src" href="#xd20e11786" name="xd20e11786src">9</a> And now
mark that, in these same regions, this idea <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb220" href="#v2pb220" name=
"v2pb220">220</a>]</span>reappears as a religious observance. Sahagun
and Herrera describe a ceremony of the Aztecs called &lsquo;eating the
god.&rsquo; Mendieta, describing this ceremony, says, &lsquo;They had
also a sort of eucharist.... They made a sort of small idols of seeds,
... and ate them as the body or memory of their gods.&rsquo; As the
seeds were cemented partly by the blood of sacrificed boys; as their
gods were cannibal gods; as Huitzilopochtli, whose worship included
this rite, was the god to whom human sacrifices were most extensive; it
is clear that the aim was to establish community with gods by taking
blood in common.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11802src" href=
"#xd20e11802" name="xd20e11802src">10</a></p>
<p>When, a little time ago, a New Zealand chief showed his high
appreciation of a learned German by eating his eyes to improve his own
intellectual vision, the case seemed to some to call for more and
better protected missionaries; but the chief might find in the
sacramental communion of the missionaries the real principle of his
faith. The celebration of the &lsquo;Lord&rsquo;s Supper&rsquo; when a
Bishop is ordained has only to be &lsquo;scratched,&rsquo; as the
proverb says, to reveal beneath it the Indians choosing their episcopal
totem. As Israel observed the Passover&mdash;eating together of the
lamb whose blood sprinkled on their door-posts had marked those to be
preserved from the Destroying Angel in Egypt&mdash;they who believed
that Jesus was Messias tasted the body and blood of their Head, as
indicating the elect out of a world otherwise given over to the
Destroyer spiritually, and finally to be delivered up to him bodily.
&lsquo;He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb221" href="#v2pb221" name=
"v2pb221">221</a>]</span>dwelleth in me and I in him.&rsquo; These were
to tread on serpents, or handle them unharmed, as it is said Paul
did<span class="corr" id="xd20e11812" title="Not in source">.</span>
They were not really to die, but to fall asleep, that they might be
changed as a seed to its flower, through literal resurrection from the
earth.</p>
<p>We should probably look in vain after any satisfactory vestiges of
the migration of the superstition concerning the mystical potency of
food. It is found fully developed in the ancient Hindu myth of the
struggle between the gods and demons for the Amrita, the immortalising
nectar, one stolen sip of which gave the monster R&aacute;hu the
imperishable nature which no other of his order possesses. It is found
in corresponding myths concerning the gods of Asgard and of Olympus.
The fall of man in the Iranian legend was through a certain milk given
by Ahriman to the first pair, Meschia and Meschiane. In Buddhist
mythology, it was eating rice that corrupted the nature of man. It was
the process of incarnation in the Gilghit legend (i. 398). The whole
story of Persephone turns upon her having eaten the seed of a
pomegranate in Hades, by which she was bound to that sphere. There is a
myth very similar to that of Persephone in Japan. There is a legend in
the Scottish Highlands that a woman was conveyed into the secret
recesses of the &lsquo;men of peace&rsquo;&mdash;the Daoine Shi&rsquo;,
euphemistic name of uncanny beings, who carry away mortals to their
subterranean apartments, where beautiful damsels tempt them to eat of
magnificent banquets. This woman on her arrival was recognised by a
former acquaintance, who, still retaining some portion of human
benevolence, warned her that, if she tasted anything whatsoever for a
certain space of time, she would be doomed to remain in that underworld
for ever. The woman having taken this counsel, was ultimately restored
to the society of mortals. It was added that, when the period named by
her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb222" href="#v2pb222" name=
"v2pb222">222</a>]</span>unfortunate friend had elapsed, a
disenchantment of this woman&rsquo;s eyes took place, and the viands
which had before seemed so tempting she now discovered to consist only
of the refuse of the earth.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11819src" href=

<p>The difficulty of tracing the ethnical origin of such legends as
these is much greater than that of tracing their common natural origin.
The effect of certain kinds of food upon the human system is very
marked, even apart from the notorious effects of the drinks made from
the vegetative world. The effects of mandrake, opium, tobacco, various
semi-poisonous fungi, the simplicity with which differences of race
might be explained by their vegetarian or carnivorous customs, would be
enough to suggest theories of the potency of food over the body and
soul of man such as even now have their value in scientific
speculation.</p>
<p>The Jewish opinion that Seth was the offspring of the divine part of
Adam was the germ of a remarkable christian myth. Adam, when dying,
desired Seth to procure the oil of mercy (for his extreme unction) from
the angels guarding Paradise. Michael informs Seth that it can only be
obtained after the lapse of the ages intervening the Fall and the
Atonement. Seth received, however, a small branch of the Tree of
Knowledge, and was told that when it should bear fruit, Adam would
recover. Returning, Seth found Adam dead, and planted the branch in his
grave. It grew to a tree which Solomon had hewn down for building the
temple; but the workmen could not adapt it, threw it aside, and it was
used as a bridge over a lake. The Queen of Sheba, about to cross this
lake, beheld a vision of Christ on the cross, and informed Solomon that
when a certain person had been suspended on that tree the fall of the
Jewish nation would be near. Solomon in alarm buried the wood deep in
the earth, and the spot was covered by the pool of Bethesda. Shortly
before the crucifixion the tree floated on that water, and ultimately,
as the cross, bore its fruit.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11834src"

<p>In our old Russian picture (<a href="#v2fig08">Fig. 8</a>) Seth is
shown offering a branch of the Tree of Knowledge to his father Adam.
That it should spring up to be the Tree of Life is simply in obedience
to Magian and Gnostic theories, which generally turn on some scheme by
which the Good turns against the Evil Mind the point of his own weapon.
These were the influences which gave to christian doctrines on the
subject their perilous precision. The universal tradition was that Adam
was the first person liberated by Christ from hell; and this
corresponded with an equally wide belief that all who were saved by the
death of Christ and his descent into hell were at once raised into the
moral condition of Adam and Eve before the Fall,&mdash;to eat the food
and breathe the holy air of Paradise.</p>
<p>An honest mirror was held up before this theology by the christian
Adamites. Their movement (second and third centuries) was a most
legitimate outcome of the Pauline and Johannine gospel. The author of
this so-called &lsquo;heresy,&rsquo; Prodicus, really anticipated the
Methodist doctrine of &lsquo;sanctification,&rsquo; and he was only
consistent in admonishing his followers that clothing was, in the
Bible, the original badge of carnal guilt and shame, and was no longer
necessary for those whom Christ had redeemed from the Fall and raised
to the original innocence of Adam and Eve. These believers, in the
appropriate climate of Northern Africa, had no difficulty in carrying
out their doctrine practically, and having named their churches
&lsquo;Paradises,&rsquo; assembled in them quite naked. There is still
a superstition in the East that a snake will never attack one who
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb225" href="#v2pb225" name=
"v2pb225">225</a>]</span>is naked. The same Adamite doctrine&mdash;a
prelapsarian perfection symbolised by nudity&mdash;was taught by John
Picard in Bohemia, and a flourishing sect of &lsquo;Adamites&rsquo;
arose there in the fifteenth century. The Slavonian Adamites of the
last century&mdash;and they are known to carry on their services still
in secret&mdash;not only dispense with clothing, but also with
sacraments and ceremonies, which are for the imperfect, not for the
perfected. Again and again has this logical result of the popular
theology appeared, and with increasingly gross circumstances, as the
refined and intelligent abandon except in name the corresponding
dogmas. It is an impressive fact that Paul&rsquo;s central doctrine of
&lsquo;a new creature&rsquo; is now adopted with most realistic
orthodoxy by the Mormons of Utah, whose initiation consists of a
dramatic performance on each candidate of moulding the body out of
clay, breathing in the nostrils, the &lsquo;deep sleep&rsquo;
presentation of an Eve to each Adam, the temptation, fall, and
redemption. The &lsquo;saints&rsquo; thus made, unfortunately, seem to
have equally realistic ideas that the Gentiles are adherents of the
Prince of this world, and their sacramental bands have shown some
striking imitations of those events of history which, when not labelled
&lsquo;Christian,&rsquo; are pronounced barbarous. Now that the old
dogmatic system is being left more and more to the ignorant and vulgar
to make over into their own image and likeness, it may be hoped that
elsewhere also the error that libels and outrages nature will run to
seed; for error, like the aloe, has its period when it shoots up a high
stem and&mdash;dies. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb226" href=

curious information is contained in the work already referred to,
<span lang="fr">&lsquo;L&rsquo;Eau Benite au Dix-neuvi&egrave;me
Si&egrave;cle.&rsquo; Par Monsignor Gaume, Protonotaire Apostolique.
Paris, 1866</span>. It is there stated that water escaped the curse;
that salt produces fecundity; that devils driven off temporarily by the
cross are effectually dismissed by holy water; that St. Vincent,
interrupted by a storm while preaching, dispersed it by throwing holy
water at it; and he advises the use of holy water against the latest
devices of the devil&mdash;spirit-rapping. It must not, however, be
supposed that these notions are confined to Catholics. Every element in
the disquisition of Monsignor Gaume is represented in the region where
his church is most hated. Mr. James Napier, in his recent book on
Folklore, shows us the Scotch hastening new-born babes to baptism lest
they become &lsquo;changelings,&rsquo; and the true meaning of the rite
is illustrated in a reminiscence of his own childhood. He was supposed
to be pining under an Evil Eye, and the old woman, or
&lsquo;skilly,&rsquo; called in, carefully locked the door, now
unlocked by her patient, and proceeded as follows:&mdash; &lsquo;A
sixpence was borrowed from a neighbour, a good fire was kept burning in
the grate, the door was locked, and I was placed upon a chair in front
of the fire. The operator, an old woman, took a tablespoon and filled
it with water. With the sixpence she then lifted as much salt as it
would carry, and both were put into the water in the spoon. The water
was then stirred with the forefinger till the salt was dissolved. Then
the soles of my feet and the palms of my hands were bathed with this
solution thrice, and after these bathings I was made to taste the
solution three times. The operator then drew her wet forefinger across
my brow&mdash;called <i>scoring aboon the breath</i>. The remaining
contents of the spoon she then cast right over the fire, into the
hinder part of the fire, saying as she did so, &lsquo;<i>Guid preserve
frae a&rsquo; skaith</i>.&rsquo; These were the first words permitted
to be spoken during the operation. I was then put in bed, and, in
attestation of the charm, recovered. To my knowledge this operation has
been performed within these forty years, and probably in many outlying
country places it is still practised. The origin of this superstition
is probably to be found in ancient fire-worship. The great blazing fire
was evidently an important element in the transaction; nor was this a
solitary instance in which regard was paid to the fire. I remember
being taught that it was unlucky to spit into the fire, some evil being
likely shortly after to befall those who did so. Crumbs left upon the
table after a meal were carefully gathered and put into the fire. The
cuttings from the nails and hair were also put into the fire. These
freaks certainly look like survivals of fire-worship.&rsquo; It may be
well here to refer the reader to what has been said in vol. i. on
Demons of Fire. The Devil&rsquo;s fear of salt and consequently of
water confirmed the perhaps earlier apprehension of all fiery phantoms
of that which naturally quenches flame.</p>

community of nature is thus established, and a community of power over

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is in the old town of Hanover, in Germany, a
schoolhouse in which, above the teacher&rsquo;s chair, there was
anciently the representation of a dove perched upon an iron branch or
rod; and beneath the inscription&mdash;&lsquo;<span class="sc">This
shall lead you into all truth.</span>&rsquo; In the course of time the
dove fell down and was removed to the museum; but there is still left
before the children the rod, with the admonition that it will lead them
into all truth. This is about as much as for a long time was left in
the average christian mind of the symbolical Dove, the Holy Ghost. Half
of its primitive sense departed, and there remained only an emblem of
mysterious terror. More spiritual minds have introduced into the modern
world a conception of the Holy Ghost as a life-giving influence or a
spirit of love, but the ancient view which regarded it as the Iron Rod
of judgment and execution still survives in the notion of the
&lsquo;sin against the Holy Ghost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Henry G. Atkinson writes as follows:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e11866src" href="#xd20e11866" name=
"xd20e11866src">1</a>&mdash;&lsquo;My old <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb227" href="#v2pb227" name="v2pb227">227</a>]</span>friend Barry
Cornwall, the fine poet, once said to me, &lsquo;My dear Atkinson, can
you tell me the meaning of the Holy Ghost; what can it possibly
mean?&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I suppose it means a
pigeon. We have never heard of it in any other form but that of the
dove descending from heaven to the Virgin Mary. Then we have the pretty
fable of the dove returning to the ark with the olive-branch, so that
the Christian religion may be called the Religion of the Pigeon. In the
Greek Church the pigeon is held sacred. St. Petersburgh is swarming
with pigeons, but they are never killed or disturbed. I knew a lady
whose life was made wretched in the belief that she had sinned the
unpardonable sin against the Holy Ghost, and neither priest nor
physician could persuade her out of the delusion, though in all other
respects she was quite sensible. She regarded herself as such a wretch
that she could not bear to see herself in the glass, and the
looking-glasses had all to be removed, and when she went to an hotel,
her husband had to go first and have the looking-glasses of the
apartments covered over. But what is the Holy Ghost&mdash;what is its
office? Sitting with Miss Martineau at her house at Ambleside one day,
a German lady, who spoke broken English, came in. She was a neighbour,
and had a large house and grounds, and kept fowls. &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo;
she said, quite excited, &lsquo;the beast has taken off another chicken
(meaning the hawk). I saw it myself. The wretch! it came down just like
the Holy Ghost, and snatched off the chicken.&rsquo; How Miss Martineau
did laugh; but I don&rsquo;t know that this story throws much light
upon the subject, since it does but bring us back to the
pigeon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It would require a volume to explain fully all the problems
suggested in this brief note, but the more important facts may be
condensed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb228" href="#v2pb228" name=
"v2pb228">228</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is difficult to show how far the natural characteristics and
habits of the dove are reflected in its wide-spread symbolism. Its
plaintive note and fondness for solitudes are indicated in the
Psalmist&rsquo;s aspiration, &lsquo;Oh that I had the wings of a dove,
then would I fly away and be at rest; lo, then would I wander far off,
and remain in the wilderness.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e11876src" href="#xd20e11876" name="xd20e11876src">2</a> It is not
a difficult transition from this association with the wilderness to
investment with a relationship with the demon of the
wilderness&mdash;Azazel. So we find it in certain passages in Jeremiah,
where the word has been suppressed in the ordinary English version.
&lsquo;The land is desolate because of the fierceness of the
dove.&rsquo; &lsquo;Let us go again to our own people to avoid the
sword of the dove.&rsquo; &lsquo;They shall flee away every one for
fear of the sword of the dove.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e11881src" href="#xd20e11881" name="xd20e11881src">3</a> In India
its lustres&mdash;blue and fiery&mdash;may have connected it with
azure-necked Siva.</p>
<p>The far-seeing and wonderful character of the pigeon as a carrier
was well known to the ancients. On Egyptian bas-reliefs priests are
shown sending them with messages. They appear in the branches of the
oaks of Dodona, and in old Russian frescoes they sometimes perch on the
Tree of Knowledge in paradise. It is said that, in order to avail
himself of this universal symbolism, Mohammed trained a dove to perch
on his shoulder. As the raven was said to whisper secrets to Odin, so
the dove was often pictured at the ear of God. In N&ocirc;tre Dame de
Chartres, its beak is at the ear of Pope Gregory the Great.</p>
<p>It passed&mdash;and did not have far to go&mdash;to be the familiar
of kings. It brought the chrism from heaven at the baptism of Clovis.
White doves came to bear the soul of Louis of Thuringia to heaven. The
dove surmounted the sceptre of Charlemagne. At the consecration of the
kings of France, after the ceremony of unction, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb229" href="#v2pb229" name=
"v2pb229">229</a>]</span>white doves were let loose in the church. At
the consecration of a monarch in England, a duke bears before the
sovereign the sceptre with the dove.</p>
<p>By association with both ecclesiastical and political sovereignty,
it came to represent very nearly the old fatal serpent power which had
lurked in all its transformations. When the Holy Ghost was represented
as a crowned man, the dove was pictured on his wrist like that falcon
with which the German lady, mentioned by Mr. Atkinson, identified it.
But in this connection its symbolism is more especially referable to a
passage in Isaiah:<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11900src" href=
"#xd20e11900" name="xd20e11900src">4</a> &lsquo;There shall come forth
a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his
roots; and the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of
wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit
of the knowledge and of the fear of the Lord.&rsquo; The sanctity of
the number seven led to the partition of the last clause into three
spirits, making up the seven, which were: Wisdom, Understanding,
Counsel, Strength, Knowledge, Piety, Fear. In some of the
representations of these where each of the seven Doves is labelled with
its name, &lsquo;Fear&rsquo; is at the top of their arch, a Psalm
having said, &lsquo;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of
wisdom.&rsquo; When the knightly Order of the Holy Ghost was created in
1352, it was aristocratic, and, when reorganised by Henry III. of
France in 1579, it was restricted to magisterial and political
personages. With them was the spirit of Fear certainly; and the Order
shows plainly what had long been the ideas connected with the Holy
Ghost.</p>
<p>M. Didron finds this confirmed in the legends of every country, and
especially refers to a story of St. Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury,
in the tenth century. Three men, convicted of coining false money, had
been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb230" href="#v2pb230" name=
"v2pb230">230</a>]</span>condemned to death. Immediately before the
celebration of mass on the day of Pentecost, the festival of the Holy
Ghost, St. Dunstan inquired whether justice had been done upon the
three criminals: he was informed in reply that the execution had been
delayed on account of the solemn feast of Pentecost then in
celebration. &lsquo;It shall not be thus,&rsquo; cried the indignant
archbishop, and gave orders for the immediate execution of the guilty
men. Several of those who were present remonstrated against the cruelty
of that order; it was nevertheless obeyed.</p>
<p>After the execution of the criminals, Dunstan washed his face, and
turned with a joyful countenance towards his oratory. &lsquo;I now
hope,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that God will be pleased to accept the
sacrifice I am about to offer;&rsquo; and in fact, during the
celebration of mass, at the moment when the Saint raised his hands to
implore that God the Father would be pleased to give peace to his
Church, to guide, guard, and keep it in unity throughout the world,
&lsquo;a dove, as white as snow, was seen to descend from heaven, and
during the entire service remained with wings extended, floating
silently in air above the head of the archbishop.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e11912src" href="#xd20e11912" name=
"xd20e11912src">5</a></p>
<p>The passionate sexual nature of the dove made it emblem of
Aphrodite, and it became spiritualised in its consecration to the
Madonna. From its relation to the falsely-accused Mary, there grew
around the Dove a special class of legends which show it attesting
female innocence or avenging it. The white dove said to have issued
from the mouth of Joan of Arc is one of many instances. There is still,
I believe, preserved in the Lyttleton family the picture painted by
Dowager Lady <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb231" href="#v2pb231"
name="v2pb231">231</a>]</span>Lyttleton in 1780, in commemoration of
the warning of death given to Lord Lyttleton by the mother of two girls
he had seduced, the vision being attended by a fluttering dove. The
original account of his vision or dream, attributed to Lord Lyttleton,
mentions only &lsquo;a bird.&rsquo; When next told, it is that he
&lsquo;heard a noise resembling the fluttering of a dove,&rsquo; and on
looking to the window saw &lsquo;an unhappy female whom he had
seduced.&rsquo; But the exigencies of orthodoxy are too strong for
original narratives. As the &lsquo;bird&rsquo; attested an announcement
that on the third day (that too was gradually added) he would die, it
must have been a dove; and as the dove attends only the innocent, it
must have been the poor girl&rsquo;s mother that appeared. It was easy
to have the woman die at the precise hour of appearance.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e11919src" href="#xd20e11919" name=
"xd20e11919src">6</a> When in Chicago in 1875, I read in one of the
morning papers a very particular account of how a white dove flew into
the chamber window of a young unmarried woman in a neighbouring
village, she having brought forth a child, and solemnly declaring that
she had never lost her virginity.</p>
<p>In this history of the symbolism of the Dove the theological
development of the Holy Ghost has been outlined. We have seen in the
previous chapter that the Holy Spirit is in opposition to the Natural
Air,&mdash;repository of evils. The Dove symbolised this aspect of it
in hovering over the world emerging from its diluvial baptism, and also
over the typical new Adam (Jesus) coming from his baptism. But in this
it corresponds with the serpent-symbol of life in Egyptian mythology
brooding over the primal mundane egg (as in <a href="#v1fig23">Fig. 23,
vol. i</a>.). Nathaniel Hawthorne found a mystical meaning in the
beautiful group at Rome representing a girl pressing a dove to her
bosom while she is attacked by a serpent. But in their theological
aspects <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb232" href="#v2pb232" name=
"v2pb232">232</a>]</span>the Dove and the Serpent blend; they are at
once related and separated in Christ&rsquo;s words, &lsquo;Be ye wise
as serpents and harmless as doves;&rsquo; but in the office of the Holy
Ghost as representing a divine Intelligence, and its consequent
evolution as executor of divine judgments, it fulfils in Christendom
much the same part as the Serpent in the more primitive
mythologies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven unto men,&rsquo;
said a legendary Christ;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11931src" href=
"#xd20e11931" name="xd20e11931src">7</a> &lsquo;but the blasphemy
against the Spirit will not be forgiven. And whosoever shall speak a
word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him, but whosoever
shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it will not be forgiven him,
neither in this world nor in that to come.&rsquo; In Mark<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e11936src" href="#xd20e11936" name=
"xd20e11936src">8</a> it is said, &lsquo;All things shall be forgiven
unto the sons of men, the sins and the blasphemies wherewith they shall
blaspheme: but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost has
never forgiveness, but will be guilty of everlasting sin; (because they
said, He has an unclean spirit).&rsquo; When Christ uttered these
tremendous words, no disciple seems to have been startled, or to have
inquired into the nature of that sin, so much worse than any offence
against himself or the Father, which has since employed so much
theological speculation.</p>
<p>In fact, they needed no explanation: it was an old story; the
unpardonable sin was a familiar feature of ancient Jewish law. Therein
the sin excluded from expiation was any presumptuous language or action
against Jehovah. It is easy to see why this was so. Real offences,
crimes against man or society, were certain of punishment, through the
common interest and need. But the honour and interests of Jehovah, not
being obvious or founded in nature, required special and severe
statutes. The less a thing is protected by its intrinsic and practical
importance, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb233" href="#v2pb233"
name="v2pb233">233</a>]</span>the more it must, if at all, be
artificially protected. This is illustrated in the story of Eli and his
two sons. These youths were guilty of the grossest immoralities, but
not a word was said against them, they being sons of the High Priest,
except a mild remonstrance from Eli himself. But when on an occasion
these youths tasted the part of the sacrificial meat offered to
Jehovah, the divine wrath was kindled. Eli, much more terrified at this
ceremonial than the moral offence, said to his sons, &lsquo;If one man
sin against another, the judge shall judge him, but if a man sin
against Jehovah, who shall entreat for him?&rsquo; In protecting his
interests, Jehovah&rsquo;s destroying angel does not allude to any
other offence of Eli&rsquo;s sons except that against himself. But when
the priestly guardians of the divine interests came with their people
under the control of successive Gallios,&mdash;aliens who cared not for
their ceremonial law, and declined to permit the infliction of its
penalties, as England now forbids <i>suttee</i> in India,&mdash;the
priests could only pass sentences; execution of them had to be
adjourned to a future world.</p>
<p>The doctrine of a future state of rewards and punishments is not one
which a priesthood would naturally prefer or invent. So long as a
priesthood possesses the power of life and death over the human body,
they would not, by suggesting future awards, risk the possibility of a
heresy arising to maintain <i lang="la">Deorum injuria diis cura</i>.
But where an alien jurisdiction has relegated to local deities the
defence of their own majesty, there must grow up the theory that such
offences as cannot be expiated on earth are unpardonable, and must,
because of the legal impunity with which they can be committed, be all
the more terribly avenged somewhere else.</p>
<p>Under alien influences, also, the supreme and absolute government of
Jehovah had been divided, as is elsewhere <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb234" href="#v2pb234" name="v2pb234">234</a>]</span>described. He
who originally claimed the empire of both light and darkness, good and
evil, when his rivalry against other gods was on a question of power,
had to be relieved of responsibility for earthly evils when the moral
sense demanded dualism. Thus there grew up a separate personification
of the destructive power of Jehovah, which had been supposed to lodge
in his breath. The last breath of man obviously ends life; there is
nothing more simple in its natural germ than the association of the
first breath and the last with the Creative Spirit.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e11957src" href="#xd20e11957" name="xd20e11957src">9</a> This
potency of the breath or spirit is found in many ancient regions. It is
the natural teaching of the destructive simoom,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e11960src" href="#xd20e11960" name="xd20e11960src">10</a> or even
of the annual autumnal breath which strikes the foliage with death.
Persia especially abounded with superstitions of this character. By a
sorcerer&rsquo;s breath the two serpents were evoked from the breast of
Zoh&aacute;k. Nizami has woven the popular notion into his story of the
two physicians who tried to destroy each other; one of whom survived
his rival&rsquo;s poisonous draught, and killed that rival by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb235" href="#v2pb235" name=
"v2pb235">235</a>]</span>making him smell a flower on which he had
breathed.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11968src" href="#xd20e11968" name=
"xd20e11968src">11</a> Such notions as these influenced powerfully the
later development of the idea of Jehovah, concerning whom it was said
of old, &lsquo;With the breath of his mouth shall he slay the
wicked;&rsquo; &lsquo;the breath of the Lord like a stream of brimstone
doth kindle (Tophet).&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile in all the Trinitarian races which were to give form to
christian Mythology, destructiveness had generally (not invariably)
become the traditional r&ocirc;le of the Third Person.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e11973src" href="#xd20e11973" name=
"xd20e11973src">12</a> In Egypt there were Osiris the Creator, Horus
the Preserver, Typhon the Destroyer; in Babylonia, Anu the Upper Air,
Sin (Uri) the Moon, Samis the Sun. In Assyria the Sun regains his
place, and deadly influences were ascribed to the Moon. In India,
Brahma the Father, Vishnu the Saviour, Siva the Destroyer; in Persia,
Zeru&acirc;ne-Akrane Infinite Time, Ormuzd the Good, Ahriman the Evil;
in Greece Zeus, Poseid&ocirc;n, and Had&ecirc;s, or Heaven, Ocean, and
Hell, were the first-born of Time. The Trinitarian form had gradually
crept in among the Jews, though their Jahvistic theology only admitted
its application to inferior deities&mdash;Cain, Abel, Seth; Moses,
Aaron, Hur; Abraham, Isaac, Jacob. As time went on, these succeeded the
ideas of Jehovah, Messias, and Wisdom. But already the serpent was the
wisest of all the beasts of the field in Jewish mythology; and the
personified Wisdom was fully prepared to be identified with Athene, the
Greek Wisdom, who sprang armed from the head of Zeus (the Air), and
whose familiar was a serpent.</p>
<p>On the other hand, however, the divine Breath had also its benign
significance. Siva (&lsquo;the auspicious&rsquo;) inherited
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb236" href="#v2pb236" name=
"v2pb236">236</a>]</span>the character of Rudra (&lsquo;roaring
storm&rsquo;), but it was rather supported later on by his wife
K&aacute;li. Athena though armed was the goddess of agriculture. The
breath of Elohim had given man life. &lsquo;I now draw in and now let
forth,&rsquo; says Krishna;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11980src" href=
"#xd20e11980" name="xd20e11980src">13</a> &lsquo;I am generation and
dissolution; I am death and immortality.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thou wilt fancy
it the dawning zephyr of an early spring,&rsquo; says S&agrave;di;
&lsquo;but it is the breath of Isa, or Jesus; for in that fresh breath
and verdure the dead earth is reviving.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e11985src" href="#xd20e11985" name="xd20e11985src">14</a>
&lsquo;The voice of the turtle is heard in the land,&rsquo; sings
Solomon.</p>
<p>When the Third Person of the Christian Trinity was constituted, it
inherited the fatality of all the previous Third Persons&mdash;the
Destroyers&mdash;while it veiled them in mystery. When the Holy Ghost
inspired the disciples the account is significant.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e11990src" href="#xd20e11990" name="xd20e11990src">15</a>
&lsquo;Suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
wind, ... and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire,
and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy
Ghost.&rsquo; This was on the Day of Pentecost, the harvest festival,
when the first-fruits were offered to the quickening Spirit or Breath
of nature; but the destructive feature is there also&mdash;the tongues
are cloven like those of serpents. The beneficent power was manifest at
the gate called Beautiful when the lame man was made to walk by
Peter&rsquo;s power; but its fatal power was with the same apostle, and
when he said, &lsquo;Why hath Satan filled thy heart to lie to the Holy
Ghost?&rsquo; instantly Ananias fell down and gave up the
ghost.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e11995src" href="#xd20e11995" name=
"xd20e11995src">16</a> The spirit was carried, it is said, in the
breath of the apostles. Its awfulness had various illustrations. Mary
offered up two doves in token of her conception by the Holy Ghost.
Jesus is described <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb237" href=
"#v2pb237" name="v2pb237">237</a>]</span>as scourging from the temple
those that sold doves, and the allegory is repeated in Peter&rsquo;s
denunciation of Simon Magus, who offered money for the gift of the Holy
Ghost.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e12003src" href="#xd20e12003" name=
"xd20e12003src">17</a></p>
<p>In one of his sermons Mr. Moody said, &lsquo;Nearly every day we
have somebody coming into the inquiry-room very much discouraged and
disheartened and cast down, because they think they have committed a
sin against the Holy Ghost, and that there is no hope for them.&rsquo;
Mr. Moody said he believed the sin was nearly impossible, but he adds
this remarkable statement, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t remember of ever
hearing a man swear by the Holy Ghost except once, and then I looked
upon him expecting him to fall dead, and my blood ran cold when I heard
him.&rsquo; But it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb238" href=
"#v2pb238" name="v2pb238">238</a>]</span>is almost as rare to hear
prayers addressed to the Holy Ghost; and both phenomena&mdash;for
praying and swearing are radically related&mdash;are no doubt survivals
of the ancient notions which I have described. The forces of nature out
of which the symbol grew, the life that springs from death and grows by
decay, is essentially repeated again by those who adhere to the letter
that kills, and also by those who ascend with the spirit that makes
alive. It is probable that no more terrible form of the belief in a
Devil survives than this Holy Ghost Dogma, which, lurking in vagueness
and mystery, like the serpent of which it was born, passes by the
self-righteous to cast its shadows over the most sensitive and lowly
minds, chiefly those of pure women prone to exaggerate their least
blemishes.</p>
<p>In right reason the fatal Holy Ghost stands as the type of that Fear
by which priesthoods have been able to preserve their institutions
after the deities around whom they grew had become unpresentable, and
which could best be fostered beneath the veil of mystery. They who love
darkness rather than light because their deeds cannot bear the light,
veil their gods not to abolish them but to preserve them. Calvinism is
veiled, and Athanasianism, and Romanism; they are all veiled idols,
whose power lives by being hid in a mass of philology and casuistry. So
long as Christianity can persuade the Pope and Dr. Martineau, Dean
Stanley and Mr. Moody, Quakers, Shakers, Jumpers, all to describe
themselves alike as &lsquo;Christians,&rsquo; its real nature will be
veiled, its institutions will cumber the ground, and draw away the
strength and intellect due to humanity; the indefinable
&lsquo;infidel&rsquo; will be a devil. This process has been going on
for a long time. The serpent-god, accursed by the human mind which grew
superior to it, has crept into its Ark; but its fang and venom linger
with that Bishop breathing on a priest, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb239" href="#v2pb239" name=
"v2pb239">239</a>]</span>priest breathing on a sick child, and bears
down side by side with science that atmosphere of mystery in which
creep all the old reptiles that throttle common sense and send their
virus <span class="corr" id="xd20e12021" title=
"Source: though">through</span> all the social frame.</p>
<p>In demonology the Holy Ghost is not a Devil, but in it are reflected
the diabolisation of Culture and Progress and Art. It was these
&lsquo;Devils&rsquo; which compelled the gods to veil themselves
through successive ages, and to spiritualise their idols and dogmas to
save their institutions. The deities concealed have proved far more
potent over the popular imagination than when visible. The indefinable
terrible menace of the Holy Ghost was a consummate reply to that
equally indefinable spirit of loathing and contempt which rises among
the cultured and refined towards things that have become unreal, their
formalities and their cant. It is this ever-recurring necessity that
enables clergymen to denounce belief in Hell and a Devil in churches
which assuredly would never have been built but for the superstition so
denounced. The ancient beliefs and the present denunciation of them are
on the same thread,&mdash;the determination of a Church to survive and
hold its power at any and every cost. The jesuitical power to veil the
dogma is the most successful method of confronting the Spirit of an
Age, which in the eye of reason is the only holy spirit, but which to
ecclesiastical power struggling with enlightenment is the only
formidable Satan. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb240" href=

&lsquo;Serpent poison.&rsquo; It is substantially the same word as the
demonic Sama&euml;l. The following is from Colonel Campbell&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Travels,&rsquo; ii. p. 130:&mdash;&lsquo;It was still the hot
season of the year, and we were to travel through that country over
which the horrid wind I have before mentioned sweeps its consuming
blasts; it is called by the Turks <span class="sc">Samiel</span>, is
mentioned by the holy Job under the name of the East wind, and extends
its ravages all the way from the extreme end of the Gulf of Cambaya up
to Mosul; it carries along with it flakes of fire, like threads of
silk; instantly strikes dead those that breathe it, and consumes them
inwardly to ashes; the flesh soon becoming black as a coal, and
dropping off the bones. Philosophers consider it as a kind of electric
fire, proceeding from the sulphurous or nitrous exhalations which are
kindled by the agitations of the winds. The only possible means of
escape from its fatal effects is to fall flat on the ground, and
thereby prevent the drawing it in; to do this, however, it is necessary
first to see it, which is not always practicable.&rsquo;</p>

Among the many survivals in civilised countries of these notions may be
noticed the belief that, in order to be free from a spell it is
necessary to draw blood from the witch above the breath, <i>i.e.</i>,
mouth and nostrils; to &lsquo;score aboon the breath&rsquo; is a
Scottish phrase. This probably came by the &lsquo;pagan&rsquo; route;
but it meets its christian kith and kin in the following story which I
find in a (MS.) Memorial sent to the House of Lords in 1869 by the Rev.
Thomas Berney, Rector of Bracon Ash, Diocese of Norwich:&mdash;&lsquo;I
was sent for in haste to privately baptize a child thought to be dying,
and belonging to parents who lived &lsquo;on the Common&rsquo; at
Hockering. It indeed appeared to be very ill, and its eyes were fixed,
and remarkably clouded and dull. Having baptized, I felt moved with a
longing desire to be enabled to heal the child; and I prayed very
earnestly to the Lord God Almighty to give me faith and strength to
enable me to do so. And I put my hands on its head and drew them down
on to its arms; and then breathed on its head three times, in the name
of the Lord Jesus Christ. And as I held its arms and looked on it
anxiously, its face became exceedingly red and dark, and as the child
gradually assumed a natural colour, the eyes became clear again; and
then it gently closed its eyes in sleep. And I told the mother <i>not
to touch it any more till it awoke</i>; but to carry it up in the
cradle as it was. The next morning I found the child perfectly well.
She had not touched it, except at four in the morning to feed it, when
it seemed dead asleep, and it did not awake till ten
o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo; This was written by an English Rector, and dated
from the Carlton Club! The italics are in the original MS. now before
me. The importance that no earthly hand should profanely touch the body
while the spirit was at work in it shows how completely systematised is
that insanity which consists of making a human mind an arena for the
survival of the unfittest.</p>

<p class="first">In the &lsquo;Padma Purana&rsquo; it is recorded that
when King Vena embraced heretical doctrine and abjured the temples and
sacrifices, the people following him, seven powerful Rishis, high
priests, visited him and entreated him to return to their faith. They
said, &lsquo;These acts, O king, which thou art performing, are not of
our holy traditions, nor fit for our religion, but are such as shall be
performed by mankind at the entrance of Kali, the last and sinful age,
when thy new faith shall be received by all, and the service of the
gods be utterly relinquished.&rsquo; King Vena, being thus in advance
of his time, was burned on the sacred grass, while a mantra was
performed for him.</p>
<p>This theory of Kali is curious as indicating a final triumph of the
enemies of the gods. In the Scandinavian theory of
&lsquo;Ragnarok,&rsquo; the Twilight of the gods, there also seems to
have been included no hope of the future victory of the existing gods.
In the Pars&iacute; faith we first meet with the belief in a general
catastrophe followed by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb241"
href="#v2pb241" name="v2pb241">241</a>]</span>supremacy and universal
sway of good. This faith characterised the later Hebrew prophecies, and
is the spirit of Paul&rsquo;s brave saying, &lsquo;When all things
shall be subjected unto him, then also shall the Son himself be subject
unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When, however, theology and metaphysics advanced and modelled this
fiery lava of prophetic and apostolic ages into dogmatic shapes, evil
was accorded an equal duration with good. The conflict between Christ
and his foes was not to end with the conversion or destruction of his
foes, but his final coming as monarch of the world was to witness the
chaining up of the Archfiend in the Pit.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s own idea of Satan, assuming certain reported
expressions to have been really uttered by him, must have been that
which regarded him as a Tempter to evil, whose object was to test the
reality of faith. &lsquo;Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked you for
himself, that he might sift you as the wheat; but I made supplication
for thee, that thy faith fail not; and when once thou hast returned,
confirm thy brethren. And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with
thee, both into prison and into death. And he said, I tell thee, Peter,
a cock will not crow this day till thou wilt thrice deny that thou
knowest me.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e12047src" href=
"#xd20e12047" name="xd20e12047src">1</a> Such a sentiment could not
convey to Jewish ears a degraded notion of Satan, except as being a
nocturnal spirit who must cease his work at cock-crow. It is an
adaptation of what Jehovah himself was said to do, in the prophecy of
Amos. &lsquo;I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the
Lord.... I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as
corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the
earth.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e12052src" href="#xd20e12052"
name="xd20e12052src">2</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb242" href=
"#v2pb242" name="v2pb242">242</a>]</span></p>
<p>Paul, too, appears to have had some such conception of Satan, since
he speaks of an evil-doer as delivered up to Satan &lsquo;for the
destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e12060src" href="#xd20e12060" name=
"xd20e12060src">3</a> There is, however, in another passage an
indication of the distinctness with which Paul and his friends had
conceived a fresh adaptation of Satan as obstacle of their work.
&lsquo;For such,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;are false apostles, deceitful
workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ. And no
marvel: for Satan transforms himself into an angel of light. It is no
great thing therefore if his ministers also transform themselves as
ministers of righteousness; whose end will be according to their
works.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e12065src" href="#xd20e12065"
name="xd20e12065src">4</a> It may be noted here that Paul does not
think of Satan himself as transforming himself to a minister of
righteousness, but of Satan&rsquo;s ministers as doing so. It is one of
a number of phrases in the New Testament which reveal the working of a
new movement towards an expression of its own. Real and far-reaching
religious revolutions in history are distinguished from mere sectarian
modifications, which they sum up in nothing more than in their new
phraseology. When Jehovah, Messias, and Satan are gradually supplanted
by Father, Christ, and Antichrist (or Man of Sin, False Christ,
Withholder (<span class="trans" title="katechon"><span class="Greek"
lang="el">&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#8051;&chi;&omicron;&nu;</span></span>),
False Prophet, Son of Perdition, Mystery of Iniquity, Lawless One), it
is plain that new elements are present, and new emergencies. These
varied phrases just quoted could not, indeed, crystallise for a long
time into any single name for the new Obstacle to the new life, for
during the same time the new life itself was too living, too various,
to harden in any definite shape or be marked with any special name. The
only New Testament writer who uses the word Antichrist is the so-called
Apostle John; and it is interesting to remark that it is by him
connected with a dogmatic statement of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb243" href="#v2pb243" name=
"v2pb243">243</a>]</span>nature of Christ and definition of heresy.
&lsquo;Every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is
of God; and every spirit that confesses not Jesus is not of God: and
this is the spirit of Antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it comes;
and now it is in the world already.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e12080src" href="#xd20e12080" name="xd20e12080src">5</a> This
language, characteristic of the middle and close of the second
century,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e12086src" href="#xd20e12086" name=
"xd20e12086src">6</a> is in strong contrast with Paul&rsquo;s utterance
in the first century, describing the Man of Sin (or of lawlessness, the
son of perdition), as one &lsquo;who opposeth and exalteth himself
above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he sat in
the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e12089src" href="#xd20e12089" name=
"xd20e12089src">7</a> Christ has not yet begun to supplant God; to Paul
he is the Son of God confronting the Son of Destruction, the divine man
opposed by the man of sin. When the <i>nature</i> of Christ becomes the
basis of a dogma, the man of sin is at once defined as the opponent of
that dogma.</p>
<p>As this dogma struggled on to its consummation and victory, it
necessarily took the form of a triumph over the C&aelig;sars, who were
proclaiming themselves gods, and demanding worship as such. The writer
of the second Epistle bearing Peter&rsquo;s name saw those christians
who yielded to such authority typified in Balaam, the erring prophet
who was opposed by the angel;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e12099src"
href="#xd20e12099" name="xd20e12099src">8</a> the writer of the Gospel
of John saw the traitor Judas as the &lsquo;son of
perdition,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e12104src" href=
"#xd20e12104" name="xd20e12104src">9</a> representing Jesus as praying
that the rest of his disciples might be kept &lsquo;out of the evil
one;&rsquo; and many similar expressions disclose the fact that,
towards the close of the second century, and throughout the third, the
chief obstacle of those who were just beginning to be called
&lsquo;Christians&rsquo; was the temptation offered by Rome to the
christians themselves to betray their sect. It was still a danger to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb244" href="#v2pb244" name=
"v2pb244">244</a>]</span>name the very imperial gods who successively
set themselves up to be worshipped at Rome, but the pointing of the
phrases is unmistakable long before the last of the pagan emperors held
the stirrup for the first christian Pontiff to mount his horse.</p>
<p>Nero had answered to the portrait of &lsquo;the son of perdition
sitting in the temple of God&rsquo; perfectly. He aspired to the title
&lsquo;King of the Jews.&rsquo; He solemnly assumed the name of
Jupiter. He had his temples and his priests, and shared divine honours
with his mistress Popp&aelig;a. Yet, when Nero and his glory had
perished under those phials of wrath described in the Apocalypse, a
more exact image of the insidious &lsquo;False Christ&rsquo; appeared
in Vespasian. His alleged miracles (&lsquo;lying wonders&rsquo;), and
the reported prediction of his greatness by a prophet on Mount Carmel,
his oppression of the Jews, who had to contribute the annual double
drachma to support the temples and gods which Vespasian had restored,
altogether made this decorous and popular emperor a more formidable
enemy than the &lsquo;Beast&rsquo; Nero whom he succeeded. The virtues
and philosophy of Marcus Aurelius still increased the danger. Political
conditions favoured all those who were inclined to compromise, and to
mingle the popular pagan and the Jewish festivals, symbols, and
ceremonies. In apocalyptic metaphor, Vespasian and Aurelius are the two
horns of the Lamb who spake like the Dragon, <i>i.e.</i>, Nero (Rev.
xiii. 11).</p>
<p>The beginnings of that mongrel of superstitions which at last gained
the name of Christianity were in the liberation, by decay of parts and
particles, of all those systems which Julius C&aelig;sar had caged
together for mutual destruction. &lsquo;With new thrones rise new
altars,&rsquo; says Byron&rsquo;s Sardanapalus; but it is still more
true that, with new thrones all altars crumble a little. At an early
period the differences <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb245" href=
"#v2pb245" name="v2pb245">245</a>]</span>between the believers in
Christ and those they called idolaters were mainly in name; and, with
the increase of Gentile converts, the adoption of the symbolism and
practices of the old religions was so universal that the quarrel was
about originality. &lsquo;The Devil,&rsquo; says Tertullian,
&lsquo;whose business it is to pervert the truth, mimics the exact
circumstances of the Divine Sacraments in the mysteries of idols. He
himself baptizes some, that is to say, his believers and followers: he
promises forgiveness of sins from the <i>sacred fount</i>, and thus
initiates them into the religion of Mithras; he thus marks on the
forehead his own soldiers: he then celebrates the <i>oblation of
bread</i>; he brings in the symbol of resurrection, and wins the crown
with the sword.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e12129src" href=
"#xd20e12129" name="xd20e12129src">10</a></p>
<p>What masses of fantastic nonsense it was possible to cram into one
brain was shown in the time of Nero, the brain being that of Simon the
Magician. Simon was, after all, a representative man; he reappears in
christian Gnosticism, and Peter, who denounced him, reappears also in
the phrenzy of Montanism. Take the followers of this Sorcerer
worshipping his image in the likeness of Jupiter, the Moon, and
Minerva; and Montanus with his wild <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb246" href="#v2pb246" name="v2pb246">246</a>]</span>women Priscilla
and Maximilla going about claiming to be inspired by the Holy Ghost to
re-establish Syrian orthodoxy and asceticism; and we have fair
specimens of the parties that glared at each other, and apostrophised
each other as children of Belial. They competed with each other by
pretended miracles. They both claimed the name of Christ, and all the
approved symbols and sacraments. The triumph of one party turned the
other into Antichrist.</p>
<p>Thus in process of time, as one hydra-head fell only to be followed
by another, there was defined a Spirit common to and working through
them all&mdash;a new devil, whose special office was hostility to
Christ, and whose operations were through those who claimed to be
christians as well as through open enemies.</p>
<p>As usual, when the phrases, born of real struggles, had lost their
meaning, they were handed up to the theologians to be made into
perpetual dogmas. Out of an immeasurable mass of theories and
speculations, we may regard the following passage from Jerome as
showing what had become the prevailing belief at the beginning of the
fifth century. &lsquo;Let us say that which all ecclesiastical writers
have handed down, viz., that at the end of the world, when the Roman
Empire is to be destroyed, there will be ten kings, who will divide the
Roman world among them; and there will arise an eleventh little king
who will subdue three of the ten kings, that is, the king of Egypt, of
Africa, and of Ethiopia; and on these having been slain, the seven
other kings will submit.&rsquo; &lsquo;And behold,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;in the ram were the eyes of a man&rsquo;&mdash;this is that we
may not suppose him to be a devil or a d&aelig;mon, as some have
thought, but a man in whom Satan will dwell utterly and
bodily&mdash;&lsquo;and a mouth speaking great things;&rsquo; for he is
the &lsquo;man of sin, the son of perdition, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb247" href="#v2pb247" name=
"v2pb247">247</a>]</span>who sitteth in the temple of God making
himself as God.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e12146src" href=
"#xd20e12146" name="xd20e12146src">11</a></p>
<p>The &lsquo;Little Horn&rsquo; of Daniel has proved a cornucopia of
Antichrists. Not only the christians but the Jews and the mussulmans
have definite beliefs on the subject. The rabbinical name for
Antichrist is Armillus, a word found in the Targum (Isa. xi. 4):
&lsquo;By the word of his mouth the wicked Armillus shall die.&rsquo;
There will be twelve signs of the Messiah&rsquo;s
coming&mdash;appearance of three apostate kings, terrible heat of the
sun, dew of blood, healing dew, the sun darkened for thirty days,
universal power of Rome with affliction for Jews, and the appearance of
the first Messias (Joseph&rsquo;s tribe), Nehemiah. The next and
seventh sign will be the appearance of Armillus, born of a marble
statue in a church at Rome. The Romans will accept him as their god,
and the whole world be subject to him. Nehemiah alone will refuse to
worship him, and for this will be slain, and the Jews suffer terrible
things. The eighth sign will be the appearance of the angel Michael
with three blasts of his trumpet&mdash;which shall call forth Elias,
the forerunner, and the true Messias (Ben David), and bring on the war
with Armillus who shall perish, and all christians with him. The ten
tribes shall be gathered into Paradise. Messias shall wed the fairest
daughter of their race, and when he dies his sons shall succeed him,
and reign in unbroken line over a beatified Israel.</p>
<p>The mussulman modification of the notion of Antichrist is very
remarkable. They call him <i>Al Dajjail</i>, that is, the impostor.
They say that Mohammed told his follower Tamisri Al-Dari, that at the
end of the world Antichrist would enter Jerusalem seated on an ass; but
that Jesus will then make his second coming to encounter him. The Beast
of the Apocalypse will aid Antichrist, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb248" href="#v2pb248" name="v2pb248">248</a>]</span>but Jesus will
be joined by Imam Mahadi, who has never died; together they will subdue
Antichrist, and thereafter the mussulmans and christians will for ever
be united in one religion. The Jews, however, will regard Antichrist as
their expected Messias. Antichrist will be blind of one eye, and deaf
of one ear. &lsquo;Unbeliever&rsquo; will be written on his forehead.
In that day the sun will rise in the west.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e12161src" href="#xd20e12161" name="xd20e12161src">12</a></p>
<p>The christians poorly requited this amicable theory of the
mussulmans by very extensively identifying Mohammed as Antichrist, at
one period. From that period came the English word <i>mawmet</i>
(idol), and <i>mummery</i> (idolatry), both of which, probably, are
derived from the name of the Arabian Prophet. Daniel&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Little Horn&rsquo; betokens, according to Martin Luther,
Mohammed. &lsquo;But what are the Little Horn&rsquo;s Eyes? The Little
Horn&rsquo;s Eyes,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;mean Mohammed&rsquo;s
Alkoran, or Law, wherewith he ruleth. In the which Law there is nought
but sheer human reason (<span lang="de">eitel menschliche
Vernunft</span>).&rsquo; ... &lsquo;For his Law,&rsquo; he reiterates,
&lsquo;teaches nothing but that which human understanding and reason
may well like.&rsquo; ... Wherefore &lsquo;Christ will come upon him
with fire and brimstone.&rsquo; When he wrote this&mdash;in his
&lsquo;army sermon&rsquo; against the Turks&mdash;in 1529, he had never
seen a Koran. &lsquo;Brother Richard&rsquo;s&rsquo; (Predigerordens)
<i lang="la">Confutatio Alcoran</i>, dated 1300, formed the exclusive
basis of his argument. But in Lent of 1540, he relates, a Latin
translation, though a very unsatisfactory one, fell into his hands, and
once more he returned to Brother Richard, and did his Refutation into
German, supplementing his version with brief but racy notes. This
Brother Richard had, according to his own <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb249" href="#v2pb249" name="v2pb249">249</a>]</span>account, gone
in quest of knowledge to &lsquo;Babylon, that beautiful city of the
Saracens,&rsquo; and at Babylon he had learnt Arabic and been inured in
the evil ways of the Saracens. When he had safely returned to his
native land he set about combating the same. And this is his
exordium:&mdash;&lsquo;At the time of the Emperor Heraclius there arose
a man, yea, a Devil, and a first-born child of Satan, ... who wallowed
in ... and he was dealing in the Black Art, and his name it was
Machumet.&rsquo; ... This work Luther made known to his countrymen by
translating and commenting, prefacing, and rounding it off by an
epilogue. True, his notes amount to little more but an occasional
&lsquo;Oh fie, for shame, you horrid Devil, you damned Mahomet,&rsquo;
or &lsquo;O Satan, Satan, you shall pay for that,&rsquo; or,
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s it, Devils, Saracens, Turks, it&rsquo;s all the
same,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;Here the Devil smells a rat,&rsquo; or briefly,
&lsquo;O Pfui Dich, Teufel!&rsquo; except when he modestly, with a
query, suggests whether those Assassins, who, according to his text,
are regularly educated to go out into the world in order to kill and
slay all Worldly Powers, may not, perchance, be the Gypsies or the
&lsquo;Tattern&rsquo; (Tartars); or when he breaks down with a
&lsquo;<span lang="la">Hic nescio quid dicat translator</span>.&rsquo;
His epilogue, however, is devoted to a special disquisition as to
whether Mohammed or the Pope be worse. And in the twenty-second chapter
of this disquisition he has arrived at the final conclusion that, after
all, the Pope is worse, and that he, and not Mohammed, is the real
&lsquo;Endechrist.&rsquo; &lsquo;<i>Wohlen</i>,&rsquo; he winds up,
&lsquo;God grant us his grace, and punish both the Pope and Mohammed,
together with their devils. I have done my part as a true prophet and
teacher. Those who won&rsquo;t listen may leave it alone.&rsquo; In
similar strains speaks the learned and gentle Melancthon. In an
introductory epistle to a reprint of that same Latin Koran which
displeased Luther so much, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb250" href=
"#v2pb250" name="v2pb250">250</a>]</span>he finds fault with Mohammed,
or rather, to use his own words, he thinks that &lsquo;Mohammed is
inspired by Satan,&rsquo; because he &lsquo;does not explain what sin
is,&rsquo; and further, since he &lsquo;showeth not the reason of human
misery.&rsquo; He agrees with Luther about the Little Horn: though in
another treatise he is rather inclined to see in Mohammed both Gog and
Magog. And &lsquo;Mohammed&rsquo;s sect,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;is
altogether made up (<i lang="la">conflata</i>) of blasphemy, robbery,
and shameful lusts.&rsquo; Nor does it matter in the least what the
Koran is all about. &lsquo;Even if there were anything less scurrilous
in the book, it need not concern us any more than the portents of the
Egyptians, who invoked snakes and cats.... Were it not that partly this
Mohammedan pest, and partly the Pope&rsquo;s idolatry, have long been
leading us straight to wreck and ruin&mdash;may God have mercy upon
<i>some</i> of us!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e12210src" href=
"#xd20e12210" name="xd20e12210src">13</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Mawmet&rsquo; was used by Wicliffe for idol in his
translation of the New Testament, Acts vii. 41, &lsquo;And they made a
calf in those days and offered a sacrifice to the Mawmet&rsquo; (idol).
The word, though otherwise derived by some, is probably a corruption of
Mohammed. In the &lsquo;Mappa Mundi&rsquo; of the thirteenth century we
find the representation of the golden calf in the promontory of Sinai,
with the superscription &lsquo;Mahum&rsquo; for Mohammed, whose name
under various corruptions, such as Mahound, Mawmet, &amp;c., became a
general byword in the medi&aelig;val languages for an idol. In a
missionary hymn of Wesley&rsquo;s Mohammed is apostrophised
as&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p>In these days, when the very mention of the Devil raises a smile, we
can hardly realise the solemnity with which his work was once viewed.
When Goethe represents Mephistopheles as undertaking to teach
Faust&rsquo;s class in theology and dwells on his orthodoxy, it is the
refrain of the faith of many generations. The Devil was not
&lsquo;God&rsquo;s Ape,&rsquo; as Tertullian called him, in any comical
way; not only was his ceremonial believed to be modelled on that of
God, but his inspiration of his followers was believed to be quite as
potent and earnest. Tertullian was constrained to write in this
strain&mdash;&lsquo;Blush, my Roman fellow-soldiers, even if ye are not
to be judged by Christ, but by any soldier of Mithras, who when he is
undergoing initiation in the cave, the very camp of the Powers of
Darkness, when the wreath is offered him (a sword being placed between
as if in semblance of martyrdom), and then about to be set on his head,
he is warned to put forth his hand and push the wreath away,
transferring it to, perchance, his shoulder, saying at the same time,
My only crown is Mithras. And thenceforth he never wears a wreath; and
this is a mark he has for a test, whenever tried as to his initiation,
for he is immediately proved to be a soldier of Mithras if he throws
down the wreath offered him, saying his crown is in his god. Let us
therefore acknowledge the craft of the Devil, who mimics certain things
of those that be divine, in order that he may confound and judge us by
the faith of his own followers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was written before the exaltation of Christianity under
Constantine. When the age of the martyrdom of the so-called pagans came
on, these formul&aelig; became real, and the christians were still more
confounded by finding that the worshippers of the Devil, as they
thought them, could yield up their lives in many parts of Europe as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb252" href="#v2pb252" name=
"v2pb252">252</a>]</span>bravely for their faith as any christian had
ever done. The &lsquo;Prince of this world&rsquo; became thus an
unmeaning phrase except for the heretics. Christ had become the Prince
of this world; and he was opposed by religious devotees as earnest as
any who had suffered under Nero. The relation of the Opposition to the
Devil was yet more closely defined when it claimed the christian name
for its schism or heresy, and when it carried its loyalty to the
Adversary of the Church to the extent of suffering martyrdom.
&lsquo;Tell me, holy father,&rsquo; said Evervinus to St. Bernard,
concerning the Albigenses, &lsquo;how is this? They entered to the
stake and bore the torment of the fire not only with patience, but with
joy and gladness. I wish your explanation, how these members of the
Devil could persist in their heresy with a courage and constancy
scarcely to be found in the most religious of the faith of
Christ?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Under these circumstances the personification of Antichrist had a
natural but still wonderful development. He was to be born of a virgin,
in Babylon, to be educated at Bethsaida and Chorazin, and to make a
triumphal entry into Jerusalem, proclaiming himself the Son of God. In
the interview at Messina (1202) between Richard I. and the Abbot
Joachim of Floris, the king said, &lsquo;I thought that Antichrist
would be born at Antioch or in Babylon, and of the tribe of Dan, and
would reign in the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem, and would walk in
that land in which Christ walked, and would reign in it for three years
and a half, and would dispute against Elijah and Enoch, and would kill
them, and would afterwards die; and that after his death God would give
sixty days of repentance, in which those might repent which should have
erred from the way of truth, and have been seduced by the preaching of
Antichrist and his false prophets.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="figureHead">Fig 9.&mdash;<span class="sc">Procession of the

</div>
<p>This belief was reflected in Western Europe in the belief that the
congregation of Witches assembled on their Sabbath (an institution then
included among paganisms) to celebrate grand mass to the Devil, and
that all the primitive temples were raised in honour of Satan. In the
Russian Church the correspondence between the good and evil powers,
following their primitive faith in the conflict between Byelbog and
Tchernibog (white god and black god), went to the curious extent of
picturing in hell a sort of infernal Trinity. The Father throned in
Heaven with the Son between his knees and the Dove beside or beneath
him, was replied to by a majestic Satan in hell, holding his Son
(Judas) on his knees, and the Serpent acting as counteragent of the
Dove. This singular arrangement may still be seen in many of the
pictures which cover the walls of the oldest Russian churches (<a href=
"#v2fig09">Fig. 9</a>). The infernal god is not without a solemn
majesty answering to that of his great antagonist above. The Serpent of
Sins proceeds from the diabolical Father and Son, passing from beneath
their throne through one of the two mouths of Hell, and then winds
upward, hungrily opening its jaws near the terrible Balances where
souls are weighed (<a href="#v2fig10">Fig. 10</a>). Along its hideous
length are seated at regular intervals nine winged devils, representing
probably antagonists of the nine Sephiroth <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb254" href="#v2pb254" name=
"v2pb254">254</a>]</span>or &AElig;ons of the Gnostic theology. Each is
armed with a hook whereby the souls weighed and found wanting may be
dragged. The sins which these devils represent are labelled, generally
on rings around the serpent, and increase in heinousness towards the
head. It is a curious fact that the Sin nearest the head is marked
&lsquo;Unmercifulness.&rsquo; Strange and unconscious sarcasm on an
Omnipotent Deity under whose sway exists this <span class="corr" id=

</div>
<p>Truly said the Epistle of John, there be many Antichrists. If this
was true before the word Christianity had been formed, or the system it
names, what was the case afterwards? For centuries we find vast systems
denouncing each other as Antichrist. And ultimately, as a subtle
hardly-conscious heresy spread abroad, the great excommunicator of
antichrists itself, Rome, acquired that title, which it has never
shaken off since. The See of Rome did not first receive that
appellation from Protestants, but from its own chiefs. Gregory himself
(<span class="sc">A.C.</span> 590) started the idea by declaring that
any man who held even the shadow of such power as the Popes arrogated
to themselves after his time would be the forerunner of Antichrist.
Arnulphus, Bishop of Orleans, in an invective against John XV. at
Rheims (<span class="sc">A.C.</span> 991), intimated that a Pope
destitute of charity was Antichrist. But the stigma was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb255" href="#v2pb255" name=
"v2pb255">255</a>]</span>at length fixed (twelfth century) by Amalrich
of Bena (&lsquo;<span lang="la">Quia Papa esset Antichristus et Roma
Babylon et ipse sedit in Monte Oliveti, <i>i.e.</i>, in pinguedine
potestatis</span>&rsquo;); and also by the Abbot Joachim (<span class=
"sc">A.C.</span> 1202). The theory of Richard I., as stated to Joachim
concerning Antichrist, has already been quoted. It was in the presence
of the Archbishops of Rouen and Auxerre, and the Bishop of Bayonne, and
represented their opinion and the common belief of the time. But
Joachim said the Second Apocalyptic Beast represented some great
prelate who will be like Simon Magus, and, as it were, universal
Pontiff, and that very Antichrist of whom St. Paul speaks. Hildebrand
was the first Pope to whom this ugly label was affixed, but the career
of Alexander VI. (Roderic Borgia) made it for ever irremovable for the
Protestant mind. There is in the British Museum a volume of
caricatures, dated 1545, in which occurs an ingenious representation of
Alexander VI. The Pope is first seen in his ceremonial robes; but a
leaf being raised, another figure is joined to the lower part of the
former, and there appears the papal devil, the cross in his hand being
changed to a pitchfork (<a href="#v2fig11">Fig. 11</a>). Attached to it
is an explanation in German giving the legend of the Pope&rsquo;s
death. He was poisoned (1503) by the cup he had prepared for another
man. It was afterwards said that he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb256" href="#v2pb256" name="v2pb256">256</a>]</span>had secured the
papacy by aid of the Devil. Having asked how long he would reign, the
Devil returned an equivocal answer; and though Alexander understood
that it was to be fifteen years, it proved to be only eleven. When in
1520 Pope Leo X. issued his formal bull against Luther, the reformer
termed it &lsquo;the execrable bull of Antichrist.&rsquo; An Italian
poem of the time having represented Luther as the offspring of
Meg&aelig;ra, the Germans returned the invective in a form more likely
to impress the popular mind; namely, in a caricature (<a href=
"#v2fig12">Fig. 12</a>), representing the said Fury as nursing the
Pope. This caricature is also of date 1545, and with it were others
showing Alecto and Tisiphone acting in other capacities for the papal
babe.</p>

</div>
<p>The Lutherans had made the discovery that the number of the
Apocalyptic Beast, 666, put into Hebrew numeral letters, contained the
words <i>Aberin Kadescha Papa</i> (our holy father the Pope). The
downfall of this Antichrist was a favourite theme of pulpit eloquence,
and also with artists. A very spirited pamphlet was printed (1521), and
illustrated with designs by Luther&rsquo;s friend Lucas Cranach. It was
entitled <i lang="de">Passional Christi und Antichristi</i>. The fall
of the papal Antichrist (<a href="#v2fig13">Fig. 13</a>), has for its
companion one of Christ washing the feet of his disciples.</p>
<p>But the Catholics could also make discoveries; and among many other
things they found that the word &lsquo;Luther&rsquo; in Hebrew numerals
also made the number of the Beast. It was remembered that one of the
earliest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb257" href="#v2pb257" name=
"v2pb257">257</a>]</span>predictions concerning Antichrist was that he
would travesty the birth of Christ from a virgin by being born of a nun
by a Bishop. Luther&rsquo;s marriage with the nun Catharine von Bora
came sufficiently near the prediction to be welcomed by his enemies.
The source of his inspiration as understood by Catholics is cleverly
indicated in a caricature of the period (<a href="#v2fig14">Fig.
14</a>).</p>

<p>The theory that the Papacy represents Antichrist has so long been
the solemn belief of rebels against its authority, that it has become a
vulgarised article of Protestant faith. On the other hand, Catholics
appear to take a political and prospective view of Antichrist. Cardinal
Manning, in his pastoral following the election of Leo XIII., said:
&lsquo;A tide of revolution has swept over all countries. Every people
in Europe is inwardly divided <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb258"
href="#v2pb258" name="v2pb258">258</a>]</span>against itself, and the
old society of Christendom, with its laws, its sanctities, and its
stability, is giving way before the popular will, which has no law, or
rather which claims to be a law to itself. This is at least the
forerunning sign of the Lawless One, who in his own time shall be
revealed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Throughout the endless exchange of epithets, it has been made clear
that Antichrist is the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the notion of a
personal Devil. From the day when the word was first coined, it has
assumed every variety of shape, has fitted with equal precision the
most contrarious things and persons; and the need of such a novel form
at one point or another in the progress of controversy is a satire on
the inadequacy of Satan and his ancient ministers. Bygone Devils cannot
represent new animosities. The ascent of every ecclesiastical or
theological system is traceable in massacres and martyrdoms;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb259" href="#v2pb259" name=
"v2pb259">259</a>]</span>each of these, whether on one side or the
other, helps to develop a new devil. The story of Antichrist shows
devils in the making. Meantime, to eyes that see how every system so
built up must sacrifice a virtue at every stage of its ascent, it will
be sufficiently clear that every powerful Church is Adversary of the
religion it claims to represent. Buddhism is Antibuddha; Islam is
Antimohammed; Christianity is Antichrist. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

&lsquo;But,&rsquo; says Professor King (Gnostics, p. 52), &lsquo;a
dispassionate examiner will discover that these two zealous Fathers
somewhat beg the question in assuming that the Mithraic rites were
invented as counterfeits of the Christian Sacraments; the former having
really been in existence long before the promulgation of
Christianity.&rsquo; Whatever may have been the incidents in the life
of Christ connected with such things, it is certainly true, as
Professor King says, that these &lsquo;were afterwards invested with
the mystic and supernatural virtues, in a later age insisted upon as
articles of faith, by succeeding and unscrupulous missionaries, eager
to outbid the attractions of more ancient ceremonies of a cognate
character.&rsquo; In the porch of the Church <i lang="it">Bocca della
Verita</i> at Rome, there is, or was, a fresco of Ceres shelling corn
and Bacchus pressing grapes, from them falling the elements of the
Eucharist to a table below. This was described to me by a friend, but
when I went to see it in 1872, it had just been whitewashed over! I
called the attention of Signor Rosa to this shameful proceeding, and he
had then some hope that this very interesting relic might be
recovered.</p>

<p class="first">On the parapet of the external gallery of N&ocirc;tre

figure (<a href="#v2fig15">15</a>). There is in the face a remarkable

<p>His seat on the fine parapet is in contrast with the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb261" href="#v2pb261" name=
"v2pb261">261</a>]</span>place assigned him in Eastern
traditions&mdash;ruins and desert places,&mdash;but otherwise he fairly
fulfilled, no doubt, early ideas in selecting his headquarters at
Paris. A mussulman legend says that when, after the Fall of Man, Allah
was mitigating the sentences he had pronounced, Iblis (who, as the
Koran relates, pleaded and obtained the deferment of his consignment to
Hell until the resurrection, and unlimited power over sinners who do
not accept the word of Allah) asked&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where shall I dwell in the meantime?</p>
<p>&lsquo;In ruins, tombs, and all other unclean places shunned by
man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What shall be my food?</p>
<p>&lsquo;All things slain in the name of idols.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How shall I quench my thirst?</p>
<p>&lsquo;With wine and intoxicating liquors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What shall occupy my leisure hours?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Music, song, love-poetry, and dancing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is my watchword?</p>
<p>&lsquo;The curse of Allah until the day of judgment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how shall I contend with man, to whom thou hast granted
two guardian angels, and who has received thy revelation?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thy progeny shall be more numerous than his,&mdash;for for
every man that is born, there shall come into the world seven evil
spirits&mdash;but they shall be powerless against the
faithful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Iblis with wine, song, and dance&mdash;the &lsquo;pride of
life&rsquo;&mdash;is also said to have been aided in entering Paradise
by the peacock, which he flattered.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e12412src" href="#xd20e12412" name="xd20e12412src">1</a></p>
<p>This fable, though later than the era of Mohammed in form, is as
ancient as the myth of Eden in substance. The germ of it is already in
the belief that Jehovah <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb262" href=
"#v2pb262" name="v2pb262">262</a>]</span>separated from the rest of the
earth a garden, and from the human world a family of his own, and from
the week a day of his own. The reply of the elect to the proud Gentile
aristocracy was an ascetic caste established by covenant with the King
of kings. This attitude of the pious caste turned the barbaric
aristocrats, in a sense, to democrats. Indeed Sama&euml;l, in whom the
execrated Dukes of Edom were ideally represented, might be almost
described as the Democratic Devil. According to an early Jewish legend,
Jehovah, having resolved to separate &lsquo;men&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i>,
Jews) from &lsquo;swine&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, idolaters, Gentiles), made
circumcision the seal on them as children of Abraham. There having
been, however, Jews who were necessarily never circumcised, their
souls, it was arranged, should pass at death into the forms of certain
sacred birds where they would be purified, and finally united to the
elect in Paradise. Now, Sama&euml;l, or Adam Belial as he was sometimes
called, is said to have appealed to the Creator that this arrangement
should include all races of beings. &lsquo;Lord of the world!&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;we also are of your creation. Thou art our father. As thou
savest the souls of Israel by transforming them that they may be
brought back again and made immortal, so also do unto us! Why shouldst
thou regard the seed of Abraham before us?&rsquo; Jehovah answered,
&lsquo;Have you done the same that Abraham did, who recognised me from
his childhood and went into Chaldean fire for love of me? You have seen
that I rescued him from your hands, and from the fiery oven which had
no power over him, and yet you have not loved and worshipped me.
Henceforth speak no more of good or evil.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e12425src" href="#xd20e12425" name="xd20e12425src">2</a></p>
<p>The old rabbinical books which record this conversation do not
report Sama&euml;l&rsquo;s answer; nor is it necessary: that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb263" href="#v2pb263" name=
"v2pb263">263</a>]</span>answer was given by Jesus and Paul breaking
down the partitions between Jew and Gentile. It was quite another
thing, however, to include the world morally. Jesus, it would seem,
aimed at this also; he came &lsquo;eating and drinking,&rsquo; and the
orthodox said Sama&euml;l was in him. Personally, he declined to
substitute even the cosmopolitan rite of baptism for the discredited
national rite of circumcision. But Paul was of another mind. His
pharisaism was spiritualised and intensified in his new faith, to which
the great world was all an Adversary.</p>
<p>It was a tremendous concession, this giving up of the gay and
beautiful world, with its mirth and amusements, its fine arts and
romance&mdash;to the Devil. Unswerving Nemesis has followed that wild
theorem in many forms, of which the most significant is Asmodeus.</p>
<p>Asmod&auml;us, or A&ecirc;shma-da&ecirc;va of the Zend texts, the
modern Persian Khasm, is etymologically what Carlyle might call
&lsquo;the god Wish;&rsquo; <i>a&ecirc;sha</i> meaning
&lsquo;wish,&rsquo; from the Sanskrit root <i>ish</i>, &lsquo;to
desire.&rsquo; An almost standing epithet of A&ecirc;shma is
Khrv&icirc;dra, meaning apparently &lsquo;having a hurtful weapon or
lance.&rsquo; He is occasionally mentioned immediately after
Anr&ocirc;-mainyus (Ahriman); sometimes is expressly named as one of
his most prominent supporters. In the remarkable combat between
Ahuro-mazda (Ormuzd) and <span class="corr" id="xd20e12443" title=
"Source: Anr&ocirc;mainyus">Anr&ocirc;-mainyus</span>, described in
Zam. Y. 46, the good deity summons to his aid Vohumano, Ashavahista,
and Fire; while the Evil One is aided by Ak&ocirc;mano, A&ecirc;shma,
and Aji-Dah&aacute;ka.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e12446src" href=
"#xd20e12446" name="xd20e12446src">3</a> Here, therefore, A&ecirc;shma
appears as opposed to Ashavahista, &lsquo;supreme purity&rsquo; of the
Lord of Fire. A&ecirc;shma is the spirit of the lower or impure Fire,
Lust and Wrath. A Sanskrit text styles him Kossa-deva, &lsquo;the god
of Wrath.&rsquo; In Ya&ccedil;na 27, 35, &#346;raosha,
A&ecirc;shma&rsquo;s opponent, is invoked to shield the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb264" href="#v2pb264" name=
"v2pb264">264</a>]</span>faithful &lsquo;in both worlds from Death the
Violent, from A&ecirc;shma the Violent, from the hosts of Violence that
raise aloft the terrible banner&mdash;from the assaults of A&ecirc;shma
that he makes along with V&iacute;d&aacute;tu (&lsquo;Divider,
Destroyer&rsquo;), the demon-created.&rsquo; He is thus the leading
representative of dissolution, the fatal power of Ahriman. Ormuzd is
said to have created &#346;raosha to be the destroyer of
&lsquo;A&ecirc;shma of the fatal lance.&rsquo; &#346;raosha (&lsquo;the
Hearer&rsquo;) is the moral vanquisher of A&ecirc;shma, in distinction
from Haoma, who is his chief opponent in the physical domain.</p>
<p>Such, following Windischmann,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e12459src"
href="#xd20e12459" name="xd20e12459src">4</a> is the origin of the
devil whom the apocryphal book of Tobit has made familiar in Europe as
Asmodeus. Aschmedai, as the Jews called him, appears in this story as
precisely that spirit described in the Avesta&mdash;the devil of
Violence and Lust, whose passion for Sara leads him to slay her seven
husbands on their wedding-night. The devils of Lust are considered
elsewhere, and Asmodeus among them; there is another aspect of him
which here concerns us. He is a fastidious devil. He will not have the
object of his passion liable to the embrace of any other. He cannot
endure bad smells, and that raised by the smoke of the fish-entrails
burnt by Tobit drives him &lsquo;into the utmost parts of Egypt, where
the angel bound him.&rsquo; It is, however, of more importance to read
the story by the light of the general reputation of Aschmedai among the
Jews and Arabians. It was notably that of the devil represented in the
Moslem tradition at the beginning of this chapter. He is the Eastern
Don Giovanni and Lothario; he plies Noah and Solomon with wine, and
seduces their wives, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb265" href=
"#v2pb265" name="v2pb265">265</a>]</span>always aims high with his
dashing intrigues. He would have cried Amen to Luther&rsquo;s
lines&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Who loves not wine, woman, and song,</p>
<p class="line">He lives a fool his whole life long.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Besides being an aristocrat, he is a scholar, the most
learned Master of Arts, educated in the great College of Hell, founded
by Asa and Asael, as elsewhere related. He was fond of gaming; and so
fashionable that Calmet believed his very name signifies fine
dress.</p>
<p>Now, the moral reflections in the Book of Tobit, and its casual
intimations concerning the position of the persons concerned, show that
they were Jewish captives of the humblest working class, whose religion
is of a type now found chiefly among the more ignorant sectarians.
Tobit&rsquo;s moral instructions to his son, &lsquo;In pride is
destruction and much trouble, and in lewdness is decay and much
want,&rsquo; &lsquo;Drink not wine to make thee drunken,&rsquo; and his
careful instructions about finding wealth in the fear of God, are
precisely such as would shape a devil in the image of Asmodeus.
Tobit&rsquo;s moral truisms are made falsities by his puritanism:
&lsquo;Prayer is good with fasting and alms and righteousness;&rsquo;
&lsquo;but give nothing to the wicked;&rsquo; &lsquo;If thou serve God
he will repay thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cakes and ale&rsquo; do not cease to exist because Tobits are
virtuous; but unfortunately they may be raised from their subordinate
to an insubordinate place by the transfer of religious restraints to
the hands of Ignorance and Cant. Asmodeus, defined against Persian and
Jewish asceticism and hypocrisy, had his attractions for men of the
world. Through him the devil became perilously associated with wit,
gallantry, and the one creed of youth which is not at all
consumptive&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Grey is all Theory,</p>
<p class="line">Green Life&rsquo;s golden-fruited tree!</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb266" href="#v2pb266" name=
"v2pb266">266</a>]</span></p>
<p>Especially did Asmodeus represent the subordination of so-called
&lsquo;religious&rsquo; and tribal distinctions to secular
considerations. As Sama&euml;l had petitioned for an extension of the
Abrahamic Covenant to all the world and failed to secure it from
Jehovah, Asmodeus proposed to disregard the distinction. There is much
in the Book of Tobit which looks as if it were written especially with
the intention of persuading Jewish youth, tempted by Babylonians to
marriage, that their lovers might prove to be succubi or incubi. Tobit
implores his son to marry in his own tribe, and not take a
&lsquo;strange woman.&rsquo; Asmodeus was as cosmopolitan as the god of
Love himself, and many of his uglier early characteristics were hidden
out of sight by such later developments.</p>
<p>Gustave Dor&eacute; has painted in his vivid way the &lsquo;Triumph
of Christianity.&rsquo; In it we see the angelic hosts with drawn
swords overthrowing the forms adored of paganism&mdash;hurling them
headlong into an abyss. So far as the battle and victory go, this is
just the conception which an early christian would have had of what
took place through the advent of Christ. It filled their souls with joy
to behold by Faith&rsquo;s vision those draped angels casting down
undraped goddesses; they would delight to imagine how the fall might
break the bones of those beautiful limbs. For they never thought of
these gods and goddesses as statues, but as real seductive devils; and
when these christians had brought over the arts, they often pictured
the black souls coming out of these fair idols as they fell.</p>
<p>Dor&eacute; may have tried to make the angels as beautiful as the
goddesses, but he has not succeeded. In this he has interpreted the
heart behind every deformity which was ever added to a pagan deity. The
horror of the monks was transparent homage. Why did they starve and
scourge their bodies, and roll them in thorns? Because <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb267" href="#v2pb267" name=
"v2pb267">267</a>]</span>not even by defacing the beautiful images were
they able to expel from their inward worship the lovely ideals they
represented.</p>
<p>It is not difficult now to perceive that the old monks were
consigning the pagan ideals to imaginary and themselves to actual
hells, in full hope of thereby gaining permanent possession of the same
beauty abjured on earth. The loveliness of the world was transient.
They grew morbid about death; beneath the rosiest form they saw the
skeleton. The heavenly angels they longed for were Venuses and Apollos,
with no skeletons visible beneath their immortalised flesh. They never
made sacrifices for a disembodied heaven. The force of self-crucifixion
lay in the creed&mdash;&lsquo;I believe in the resurrection of the
body, and the life everlasting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The world could not generally be turned into a black procession at
its own funeral. In proportion to the conquests of Christianity must be
its progressive surrender to the unconquerable&mdash;to human nature.
Aphrodite and Eros, over whose deep graves nunneries and monasteries
had been built, were the first to revive, and the story, as Mr. Pater
has told it, is like some romantic version of Ishtar&rsquo;s Descent
into Hades and her resurrection.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e12497src"
href="#xd20e12497" name="xd20e12497src">5</a> While as yet the earth
seemed frostbound, long before the Renaissance, the song of the turtle
was heard in the ballad of Aucassin and Nicolette. The christian knight
will marry the beautiful Saracen, and to all priestly warnings that he
will surely go to hell, replies, &lsquo;What could I do in Paradise? I
care only to go where I can be with Nicolette. Who go to Paradise? Old
priests, holy cripples, dried-up monks, who pass their lives before
altars. I much prefer Hell, where go the brave, the gay, and beautiful.
There will be the players on harps, the classic <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb268" href="#v2pb268" name=
"v2pb268">268</a>]</span>poets and singers; and there I shall not be
parted from Nicolette!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Along with pretty Saracen maidens, or memories of them, were brought
back into Europe legends of Asmodeus. Aphrodite and Eros might disguise
themselves in his less known and less anathematised name, so that he
could manage to sing of his love for Sara, of Parsi for Jewess, under
the names of christian Aucassin and saracen Nicolette. In the Eastern
Church he reappeared also. There are beautiful old pictures which show
the smart cavalier, feather-in-cap, on the youth&rsquo;s left, while on
his right stands &lsquo;grey Theory&rsquo; in the form of a
long-bearded friar. Such pictures, no doubt, taught for many a
different lesson from that intended&mdash;namely, that the beat of the
heart is on the left.</p>
<p>Where St. Benedict rolled himself in thorns for dreaming of
<i>his</i> (deserted) &lsquo;Nicolette,&rsquo; St. Francis planted
roses; and the Latin Church had to recognise this evolution of seven
centuries. They hid the thorns in the courts of convents, and sold the
roses to the outside world as indulgences. But as Asmodeus had not
respected the line between Jew and Gentile in Nineveh, so he passed
over that between priest, nun, and worldling in the West. In the days
of Witchcraft the Church was scandalised by the rumour that the nuns of
the Franciscan Convent of Louviers had largely taken to sorcery, and
were attending the terrible &lsquo;Witches&rsquo; Sabbaths.&rsquo; The
nun most prominent in this affair was one Madeleine Bavent. The priests
announced that she had confessed that she was borne away to the orgies
by the demon Asmodeus, and that he had induced her to profane the
sacred host. It turned out that the nuns had engaged in intrigues with
the priests who had charge of them&mdash;especially with Fathers David,
Picard, and Boul&eacute;&mdash;but Asmodeus was credited with the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb269" href="#v2pb269" name=
"v2pb269">269</a>]</span>crime, and the nuns were punished for it.
Madeleine was condemned to life-long penance, and Picard anticipated
the fire by a suicide, in which he was said to have been assisted by
the devil.</p>
<p>Following the rabbinical tradition which represented him as
continually passing from the high infernal College of Asa and Asael to
the earth to apply his arts of sorcery, Asmodeus gained a respectable
position in European literature through the romance of Le Sage
(&lsquo;Le Diable Boiteux&rsquo;), and his fame so gained did much to
bring about in France that friendly feeling for the Devil which has
long been a characteristic of French literature. A very large number of
books, periodicals, and journals in France have gained popularity
through the Devil&rsquo;s name. Asmodeus was, in fact, the
Arch-bohemian. As such, he largely influenced the conception of
Mephistopheles as rendered by Goethe&mdash;himself the Prince of
Bohemians. The old horror of Asmodeus for bad smells is insulted in the
name Mephistopheles, and this devil is many rolled into one; yet in
many respects his kinship to Asmodeus is revealed. All the dried
starveling Anthonys and Benedicts are, in a cultured way, present in
the theologian and scholar Faust; all the sweet ladies that haunted
their seclusion became realistic in Gretchen. She is the Nemesis of
suppressed passions.</p>
<p>One province of nature after another has been recovered from
Asceticism. In this case Ishtar has had to regain her apparel and
ornaments at successive portals that are centuries, and they are not
all recovered yet. But we have gone far enough, even in puritanised
England, to produce a &lsquo;madman&rsquo; far-seeing enough to behold
<i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>. The case of Asmodeus is stated
well, albeit radically, by William Blake, in that proverb which was
told him by the devils, whom he alone <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb270" href="#v2pb270" name="v2pb270">270</a>]</span>of midnight
travellers was shrewd enough to consult: &lsquo;The pride of the
peacock is the glory of God; the lust of the goat is the bounty of God;
the wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God.&rsquo; When that statement
is improved, as it well may be, it will be when those who represent
religion shall have learned that human like other nature is commanded
by obedience.</p>
<p>In this connection may be mentioned a class of legends indicating
the Devil&rsquo;s sensitiveness with regard to his personal appearance.
The anxiety of the priests and hermits to have him represented as
hideous was said to have been warmly resented by Satan, one of the most
striking being the legend of many versions concerning a Sacristan, who
was also an artist, who ornamented an abbey with a devil so ugly that
none could behold it without terror. It was believed he had by
inspiration secured an exact portrait of the archfiend. The Devil
appeared to the Sacristan, reproached him with having made him so ugly,
and threatened to punish him grievously if he did not make him better
looking. Although this menace was thrice repeated, the Sacristan
refused to comply. The Devil then tempted him into an intrigue with a
lady of the neighbourhood, and they eloped after robbing the abbey of
its treasure. But they were caught, and the Sacristan imprisoned. The
Devil then appears and offers to get him out of his trouble if he will
only destroy the ugly likeness, and make another and handsomer. The
Sacristan consented, and suddenly found himself in bed as if nothing
had happened, while the Devil in his image lay in chains. The Devil
when discovered vanished; the Sacristan got off on the theory that
crimes and all had been satanic juggles. But the Sacristan took care to
substitute a handsome devil for the ugly <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb271" href="#v2pb271" name="v2pb271">271</a>]</span>one. In another
version the Sacristan remained faithful to his original portraiture of
the Devil despite all menaces of the latter, who resolved to take a
dire revenge. While the artist was completing his ornamentation of the
abbey with an image of the Virgin, made as beautiful as the fiend near
it was ugly, the Devil broke the ladder on which he was working, and a
fatal fall was only prevented by the hand of the Madonna he had just
made, which was outstretched to sustain him. The accompanying picture
of this scene (<a href="#v2fig16">Fig. 16</a>) is from &lsquo;Queen
Mary&rsquo;s Psalter&rsquo; in the British Museum.</p>
<p>Vasari relates that when Spinello of Arezzo, in his famous fresco of
the fall of the rebellious angels, had painted the hideous devil with
seven faces about his body, the fiend appeared to him in the same form,
and asked the artist where he had seen him in so frightful an aspect,
and why he had treated him so ignominiously. When Spinello awoke in
horror, he fell into a state of gloom, and soon after died.</p>

<p class="first">Boehme relates that when Satan was asked the cause of
God&rsquo;s enmity to him and his consequent downfall, he replied,
&lsquo;I wished to be an artist.&rsquo; There is in this quaint
sentence a very true intimation of the allurements which, in ancient
times, the arts of the Gentile possessed for the Jews and christian
judaisers. Indeed, a similar feeling towards the sensuous attractions
of the Catholic and Ritualistic Churches is not uncommon among the
prosaic and puritanical sects whose younger members are often thus
charmed away from them. Dr. Donne preached a sermon before Oliver
Cromwell at Whitehall, in which he affirmed that the Muses were damned
spirits of devils; and the discussion on the Drama which occurred at
Sheffield Church Congress (1878), following Dr. Bickerstith&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb273" href="#v2pb273" name=
"v2pb273">273</a>]</span>opening discourse on &lsquo;the Devil and his
wiles,&rsquo; shows that the Low Church wing cherishes much the same
opinion as that of Dr. Donne. The dread of the theatre among some sects
amounts to terror. The writer remembers the horror that spread through
a large Wesleyan circle, with which he was connected, when a
distinguished minister of that body, just returned from Europe,
casually remarked that &lsquo;the theatre at Rome seemed to be poorly
supported.&rsquo; The fearful confession spread through the
denomination, and it was understood that the observant traveller had
&lsquo;made shipwreck of faith.&rsquo; The Methodist instinct told
true: the preacher became an accomplished Gentile.</p>
<p>Music made its way but slowly in the Church, and the suspicion of it
still lingers among many sects. The Quakers took up the burthen of
Epiphanius who wrote against the flute-players, &lsquo;After the
pattern of the serpent&rsquo;s form has the flute been invented for the
deceiving of mankind. Observe the figure that the player makes in
blowing his flute. Does he not bend himself up and down to the right
hand and to the left, like unto the serpent? These forms hath the Devil
used to manifest his blasphemy against things heavenly, to destroy
things upon earth, to encompass the world, capturing right and left
such as lend an ear to his seductions.&rsquo; The unregenerate birds
that carol all day, be it Sabbath or Fast, have taught the composer
that his best inspiration is from the Prince of the Air. Tartini wrote
over a hundred sonatas and as many <span class="corr" id="xd20e12605"
title="Source: cencertos">concertos</span>, but he rightly valued above
them all his &lsquo;<span lang="it">Sonata del Diavolo</span>.&rsquo;
Concerning this he wrote to the astronomer Lalande:&mdash;&lsquo;One
night, in the year 1713, I dreamed that I had made a compact with his
Satanic Majesty, by which he was received into my service. Everything
succeeded to the utmost of my desires, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb274" href="#v2pb274" name=
"v2pb274">274</a>]</span>my every wish was anticipated by my new
domestic. I thought that, in taking up my violin to practise, I
jocosely asked him if he could play on this instrument. He answered
that he believed he was able to pick out a tune; when, to my
astonishment, he began a sonata, so strange, and yet so beautiful, and
executed in so masterly a manner, that in the whole course of my life I
had never heard anything so exquisite. So great was my amazement that I
could scarcely breathe. Awakened by the violence of my feelings, I
instantly seized my violin, in the hope of being able to catch some
part of the ravishing melody which I had just heard, but all in vain.
The piece which I composed according to my scattered recollections is,
it is true, the best I ever produced. I have entitled it,
&lsquo;<span lang="it">Sonata del Diavolo</span>;&rsquo; but it is so
far inferior to that which had made so forcible an impression on me,
that I should have dashed my violin into a thousand pieces, and given
up music for ever in despair, had it been possible to deprive myself of
the enjoyments which I receive from it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fire and originality of Tartini&rsquo;s great work is a fine
example of that power which Timoleon called <i>Automatia</i>, and
Goethe the <i lang="de">D&auml;monische</i>,&mdash;&lsquo;that which
cannot be explained by reason or understanding; it is not in my nature,
but I am subject to it.&rsquo; &lsquo;It seems to play at will with all
the elements of our being.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Puritans brought upon England and America that relapse into the
ancient asceticism which was shown in the burning of great pictures by
Cromwell&rsquo;s Parliament. It is shown still in the jealousy with
which the puritanised mind in both countries views all that aims at the
simple decoration of life, and whose ministry is to the sense of
beauty. On that day of the week when England and New England hebraise,
as Matthew Arnold says, it is observable that the sabbatarian fury is
especially directed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb275" href=
"#v2pb275" name="v2pb275">275</a>]</span>against everything which
proposes to give simple pleasure or satisfy the popular craving for
beauty. Sabbatarianism sees a great deal of hard work going on, but is
not much troubled so long as it is ugly and dismal work. It utters no
cry at the thousands of hands employed on Sunday railways, but is
beside itself if one of the trains takes excursionists to the seaside,
and is frantic at the thought of a comparatively few persons being
employed on that day in Museums and Art Galleries. It is a survival of
the old feeling that the Devil lurks about all beauty and pleasure.</p>
<p>A money-making age has measurably dispersed the superstitions which
once connected the Devil with all great fortunes. For a long time, and
in many regions of the world, the Jews suffered grievously by being
supposed to get their wealth by the Devil&rsquo;s help. Their wealth
(largely the result of their not exchanging it for worldly enjoyments)
so often proved their misfortune, that it was easy to illustrate by
their case the monkish theory that devil&rsquo;s gifts turn to ashes.
Princes were indefatigable in relieving the Jews of such ashes,
however. The Lords of Triar, who possessed the mines of Glucksbrunn,
were believed to have been guided to them by a gold stag which often
appeared to them&mdash;of course the Devil. It is related that when St.
Wolfram went to convert the Frislanders, their king, Radbot, was
prevented from submitting to baptism by a diabolical deception. The
Devil appeared to him as an angel clothed in a garment woven of gold,
on his head a jewelled diadem, and said, &lsquo;Bravest of men! what
has led thee to depart from the Prince of thy gods? Do it not; be
steadfast to thy religion and thou shalt dwell in a house of gold which
I will give into thy possession to all eternity. Go to Wolfram
to-morrow, ask him about those bright dwellings he promises thee. If he
cannot show them, let both parties <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb276" href="#v2pb276" name="v2pb276">276</a>]</span>choose an
ambassador; I will be their leader and will show them the gold house I
promise thee.&rsquo; St. Wolfram being unable to show Radbot the bright
dwellings of Paradise, one of his deacons was sent along with a
representative of the king, and the Devil (disguised as a traveller)
took them to the house of gold, which was of incredible size and
splendour. The Deacon exclaimed, &lsquo;If this house be made by God it
will stand for ever; if by the Devil, it must vanish speedily.&rsquo;
Whereupon he crossed himself; the house vanished, and the Deacon found
himself with the Frislander in a swamp. It took them three days to
extricate themselves and return to King Radbot, whom they found
dead.</p>
<p>The ascetic principle which branded the arts, interests, pursuits,
and pleasures of the world as belonging to the domain of Satan,
involved the fatal extreme of including among the outlawed realms all
secular learning. The scholar and man of science were also declared to
be inspired by the &lsquo;pride of life.&rsquo; But this part of our
subject requires a separate chapter. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">In Lucas van Leyden&rsquo;s picture of Satan tempting
Christ (<a href="#v2fig06">Fig. 6</a>), the fiend is represented in the
garb of a University man of the time. From his head falls a streamer
which coils on the ground to a serpent. From that serpent to the
sceptical scholar demanding a miracle the evolution is fully traceable.
The Serpent, of old the &lsquo;seer,&rsquo; was in its Semitic
adaptation a tempter to forbidden knowledge. This was the earliest
priestly outcry against &lsquo;godless education.&rsquo;</p>
<p>During the Shakespere tercentenary festival at Stratford-on-Avon,
the Bishop of St. Andrews declared that there is not a word in the
Bible warranting homage to Intellect, and such a boast beside the grave
of the most intellectual of Englishmen is in itself a survival
illustrating the tremendous curse hurled by jealous Jehovah on
man&rsquo;s first effort to obtain knowledge. That same Serpent of
knowledge has passed very far, and his curse has many times been
repeated. In the Accadian poem of the fatal Seven, as we have seen, it
is said, &lsquo;In watching was their office;&rsquo; and the Assyrian
version says, &lsquo;Unto heaven that which was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb278" href="#v2pb278" name=
"v2pb278">278</a>]</span>not seen they raised.&rsquo; On the Babylonian
cylinders is inscribed the curse of the god of Intelligence (Hea) upon
man&mdash;&lsquo;Wisdom and knowledge hostilely may they injure
him.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e12653src" href="#xd20e12653"
name="xd20e12653src">1</a> The same Serpent twined round the staff of
&AElig;sculapius and whispered those secrets which made the gods
jealous, so that Jove killed the learned Physician with a flash of
lightning. Its teeth were sown when Cadmus imported the alphabet into
Greece; and when these alphabetical dragon&rsquo;s-teeth had turned to
type, the ancient curse was renewed in legends which connected Fust
with the Devil.</p>
<p>The Hebrews are least among races responsible for the legend which
has drifted into Genesis. Nor was the Bishop&rsquo;s boast about their
Bible correct. The homage paid to Solomon was hardly on account of his
moral character. &lsquo;He spake of trees, from the cedar-tree that is
in Lebanon, even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall; he
spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of
fishes.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e12658src" href="#xd20e12658"
name="xd20e12658src">2</a> While the curse on man for eating the fruit
of knowledge is never quoted in the Hebrew scriptures, there are many
indications of their devotion to knowledge; and their prophets even
heard Jehovah saying, &lsquo;My people are destroyed through lack of
knowledge.&rsquo; It is not wonderful, therefore, that we find among
the Jews the gradual growth of a legend concerning Seth, which may be
regarded as a reply to the curse on the Serpent.</p>
<p>The apotheosis of Seth in rabbinical and mussulman mythology
represents a sort of Semitic Renaissance. As we have seen in a former
chapter, the Egyptians and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb279" href=
"#v2pb279" name="v2pb279">279</a>]</span>Greeks identified Set with
Typhon, but at the same time that demon was associated with science. He
is astronomically located in Capricorn, the sphere of the hierophants
in the Egyptian Mysteries, and the mansion of the guardians of science.
Thus he would correspond with the Serpent, who, as adapted by the
Hebrews in the myth of Eden, whispers to Eve of divine knowledge. But,
as detached from Typho, Seth, while leaving behind the malignancy,
carried away the reputation for learning usually ascribed to devils.
Thus, while we have had to record so many instances of degraded
deities, we may note in Seth a converted devil. In the mussulman and
rabbinical traditions Seth is a voluminous author; he receives a
library from heaven; he is the originator of astronomy and of many
arts; and, as an instructor in cultivation, he restores many an acre
which as Set he had blighted. In the apocryphal Genesis he is
represented as having been caught up to heaven and shown the future
destiny of mankind. Anastasius of Sinai says that when God created Adam
after his own image, he breathed into him grace and illumination, and a
ray of the Holy Spirit. But when he had sinned this glory left him.
Then he became the father of Cain and Abel. But afterwards it is said
Adam &lsquo;begat a son in his own likeness, after his image, and
called his name &lsquo;Seth,&rsquo; which is not said of Cain and Abel;
and this means that Seth was begotten in the likeness of unfallen man
in paradise&mdash;Seth meaning &lsquo;Resurrection.&rsquo; And all
those then living, when they saw how the face of Seth shone with divine
light, and heard him speak with divine wisdom, said, He is God;
therefore his sons were commonly called the sons of God.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e12665src" href="#xd20e12665" name=
"xd20e12665src">3</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb280" href=
"#v2pb280" name="v2pb280">280</a>]</span></p>
<p>That this &lsquo;Resurrection&rsquo; of departed glory and wisdom
was really, as I have said, a Renaissance&mdash;a restoration of
learning from the curse put upon it in the story of the
Serpent&mdash;is indicated by its evolution in the Gnostic myth wherein
Seth was made to avenge Satan. He took under his special care the Tree
of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and planted it in his father&rsquo;s
grave (<a href="#v2fig08">Fig. 8</a>). Rabbins carried their homage to
Seth even to the extent of vindicating Saturn, the most notorious of
planets, and say that Abraham and the Prophets were inspired by
it.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e12682src" href="#xd20e12682" name=
"xd20e12682src">4</a> The Dog (Jackal) was, in Egyptian symbols, emblem
of the Scribe; Sirius was the Dog-star domiciled with Saturn; Seth was
by them identified with Sirius, as the god of occult and infernal
<span class="corr" id="xd20e12685" title=
"Source: knowlege">knowledge</span>. He was near relative of the
serpent Sesha, familiar of &AElig;sculapius, and so easily connected
with the subtlest of the beasts in Eden which had crept in from the
Iranian mythology.</p>
<p>This reaction was instituted by scholars, who, in their necessarily
timid way of fable, may be said to have recovered the Tree of Knowledge
under guise of homage to Seth. It flourished, as we have seen (chap.
xi.), to the extent of finally raising the Serpent to be a god, and
lowering Jehovah who cursed him to a jealous devil!</p>
<p>But the terror with which Jehovah is said to have been inspired when
he said, &lsquo;The man has become as one of us, to know good and
evil,&rsquo; never failed to reappear among priesthoods when anything
threatened to remove the means of learning from under their control.
The causes of this are too many to be fully considered here; but the
main cause unquestionably was the tendency of learning to release men
from the sway of the priest. The primitive man of science would
speedily discover how many things existed of which his priest was
ignorant, and thus the germ <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb281"
href="#v2pb281" name="v2pb281">281</a>]</span>of Scepticism would be
planted. The man who possessed the Sacred Books, in whole or in part,
might become master of the &lsquo;spells&rsquo; supposed to be
contained in its words and sentences, and might use them against the
priests; or, at any rate, he might feel independent of the ordinary
apparatus of salvation.</p>
<p>The anxiety of priests to keep fast hold of the keys of learning, so
that no secular son of Adam should become &lsquo;as one of them,&rsquo;
coupled with the wonderful powers they professed ability to exercise,
powerfully stimulated the curiosity of intellectual men, and led them
to seek after this forbidden fruit in subtle ways, which easily
illustrated the story of the Serpent. The poet Shelley, who was
suspected at Oxford because of his fondness for chemistry, recognised
his mythological ancestry, and used to speak of &lsquo;my cousin, the
Serpent.&rsquo; The joke was born of circumstances sufficiently
scandalous in the last generation to make the Oxonian of to-day blush;
but the like histories of earlier ages are so tragical that, when fully
known by the common people, they will change certain familiar badges
into brands of shame. While the cant goes on about the Church being the
protector of learning through the dark ages, the fact is that, from the
burning of valuable books at Ephesus by christian fanatics (Acts xix.
19) to the present day, the Church has destroyed tenfold more important
works than it ever produced, and almost suffocated the intellectual
life of a thousand years. Amid the unbroken persecution of the Jews by
christian cruelty, which lasted from the early eleventh century for
five hundred years, untold numbers of manuscripts were destroyed, which
might have now been giving the world full and clear knowledge
concerning ages, for whose records arch&aelig;ological scholars are
painfully exploring the crumbled ruins of the East. Synagogues were
believed to be temples of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb282" href=
"#v2pb282" name="v2pb282">282</a>]</span>Satan; they were plundered and
razed to the ground, and their precious archives strewed the streets of
many cities. On the 17th of June 1244 twenty-four cartloads of these
ancient MSS. were burned in Paris alone. &ldquo;And all this by our
holy &lsquo;protector of learning&rsquo; through the Middle Ages!</p>
<p>The Japanese have pictures of a famous magician who conjured up a
demon&mdash;vast, vague, and terrible&mdash;out of his inkstand. They
call it latterly &lsquo;emblem of a licentious press,&rsquo; but, no
doubt, it was originally used to terrify the country generally
concerning the press. That Devil has also haunted the ecclesiastical
imagination in Europe. Nearly every book written without priestly
command was associated with the Devil, and there are several old books
in Europe, laboriously and honestly written, which to this day are
invested with popular superstitions reporting the denunciations with
which they were visited. For some centuries it has been believed in
Denmark and neighbouring countries that a strange and formidable book
exists, by means of which you can raise or lay the Devil. It is
vulgarly known as the <i>Book of Cyprianus</i>. The owner of it can
neither sell, bury, or burn it, and if he cannot get rid of it before
his death, he becomes the prey of the fiend. The only way of getting
rid of it is to find somebody who will accept it as a present, well
knowing what it is. Cyprianus is said to have been a clever and
virtuous young student, but he studied the black art in Norway, and
came under the power of the Devil, who compelled him to use his unholy
learning to evil ends. This grieved him sorely, and he wrote a book, in
which he shows first, how evil shall be done, and then how to
counteract it. The book is probably one which really exists or existed,
and professed to teach the art of sorcery, and likewise the charms
against it. It consists of three parts, severally called <i>Cyprianus,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb283" href="#v2pb283" name=
"v2pb283">283</a>]</span>Dr. Faust</i>, and <i>Jacob Ramel</i>. The two
latter are written in cypher. It teaches everything appertaining to
&lsquo;signing,&rsquo; conjuring, second sight, and all the charms
alluded to in Deuteronomy xviii. 10&ndash;12. The person possessing
Cyprianus&rsquo; book is said never to be in need of money, and none
can harm him. The only way of getting rid of it is to put it away in a
secret place in a church along with a clerk&rsquo;s fee of four
shillings.</p>
<p>In Stockholm I saw the so-called <i>Devil&rsquo;s Bible</i>, the
biggest book in the world, in the Royal Library. It is literally as
they describe it, &lsquo;<i lang="la">gigas librorum</i>&rsquo;: no
single man can lift it from the floor. It was part of the booty carried
off by the Swedes after the surrender of Prague, <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 1648. It contains three hundred parchment leaves, each
one made of an ass&rsquo;s hide, the cover being of oak planks,
1&frac12; inches thick. It contains the Old and New Testaments;
<i lang="la">Josephi Flavii Antiquitates Judaic&aelig;; Isidori
Episcopi L. XX. de diversis materiis; Confessio peccatorum</i>; and
some other works. The last-named production is written on black and
dark brown ground with red and yellow letters. Here and there sentences
are marked &lsquo;<i lang="la">h&aelig;c sunt suspecta</i>,&rsquo;
&lsquo;<i lang="la">superstitiosa</i>,&rsquo; &lsquo;<i lang=
"la">prohibita</i>.&rsquo; One MS., which is headed, &lsquo;<i lang=
"la">Experimentum de furto et febribus</i>&rsquo;, is a treatise in
Monkish Latin on the exorcism of ghosts and evil spirits, charms
against thieves and sickness, and various prescriptions in &lsquo;White
Magic.&rsquo; The age of the book is considerably over three hundred
years. The autograph of a German emperor is in it: &lsquo;<span lang=
"la">Ferdinandus Imperator Romanorum</span>, <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 1577.&rsquo; The volume is known in Sweden as <i lang=
"se">Fan&rsquo;s Bibel</i> (Devil&rsquo;s Bible). The legend says, that
a monk, suspected of black arts, who had been condemned to death,
begged for life, and his judge mockingly told him that he would be
pardoned only if he should produce next morning all the books here
found <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb284" href="#v2pb284" name=
"v2pb284">284</a>]</span>and in this vast size. The monk invoked the
Devil&rsquo;s assistance, and the ponderous volume was written in a
single night. This Devil must have been one who prided himself more on
his literary powers than his personal appearance; for the face and form
said to be his portrait, frontispiece of the volume, represent a most
hideous ape, green and hairy, with horrible curled tusks. It is, no
doubt, the ape <i lang="de">Anerhahn</i> of the Wagner legends;
Burns&rsquo;s &lsquo;towzie tyke, black, grim, and
large.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e12757src" href="#xd20e12757"
name="xd20e12757src">5</a></p>
<p>I noticed particularly in this old work the recurrence of deep red
letters and sentences similar to the ink which Fust used at the close
of his earliest printed volumes to give his name, with the place and
date of printing. Now Red is sacred in one direction as symbolising the
blood of Christ, but it is also the colour of Judas, who betrayed that
blood. Hence, while red letters might denote sacred days and sentences
in priestly calendars, they might be supposed mimicry of such
sanctities by &lsquo;God&rsquo;s Ape&rsquo; if occurring in secular
works or books of magic. It is said that these red letters were
especially noted in Paris as indications of the diabolical origin of
the works so easily produced by Fust; and, though it is uncertain
whether he suffered imprisonment, the red lines with his name appear to
have been regarded as his signature in blood.</p>
<p>For a long time every successive discovery of science, every
invention of material benefit to man, was believed by priest-ridden
peoples to have been secured by compact with the devil. The fate of the
artist Prometheus, fettered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb285"
href="#v2pb285" name="v2pb285">285</a>]</span>by jealous Jove, was
repeated in each who aspired to bring light to man, and some men of
genius&mdash;such as Cornelius Agrippa, and Paracelsus&mdash;appear to
have been frightened away from legitimate scientific research by the
first connection of their names with sorcery. They had before them the
example of the greatest scientific man of the Middle Ages, Roger Bacon,
and knew how easily, in the priestly whisper, the chemist&rsquo;s
crucible grew to a wizard&rsquo;s cauldron. The time may come when
Oxford University will have learned enough to build a true memorial of
the grandest man who ever wrote and taught within its walls. It would
show Roger Bacon&mdash;rectifier of the Julian Calendar, analyst of
lenses, inventor of spectacles and achromatic lenses, probable
constructor of the first telescope, demonstrator of the chemical action
of air in combustion, inventor of the mode of purifying saltpetre and
crystallising it into gunpowder, anticipator of the philosophical
method with which his namesake is credited&mdash;looking on a pile of
his books for whose researches he had paid two thousand French livres,
to say nothing of a life&rsquo;s labour, only to see them condemned by
his University, their circulation prohibited; and his sad gaze might be
from the prison to which the Council of Franciscans at Paris sentenced
him whom Oxford gladly delivered into their hands. He was condemned,
says their historian Wadding, &lsquo;<i lang="la">propter novitates
quasdam suspectas</i>.&rsquo; The suspected novelties were crucibles,
retorts, and lenses that made the stars look larger. So was it with the
Oxford six hundred years ago. Undeniably some progress had been made
even in the last generation, for Shelley was only forbidden to study
chemistry, and expelled for his metaphysics. But now that it is claimed
that Oxford is no longer partaker with them that stoned investigators
and thinkers from Bacon to Shelley, it would be in order to build for
its own great martyr of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb286" href=
"#v2pb286" name="v2pb286">286</a>]</span>science a memorial, that
superstition may look on one whom it has pierced.</p>

</div>
<p>Referring to Luther&rsquo;s inkstand thrown at the Devil, Dr.
Zerffii, in his lecture on the Devil, says, &lsquo;He (the devil) hates
nothing so much as writing or printer&rsquo;s ink.&rsquo; But the truth
of this remark depends upon which of two devils be considered. It would
hardly apply to the Serpent who recommended the fruit of knowledge, or
to the University man in Lucas van Leyden&rsquo;s picture (<a href=
"#v2fig06">Fig. 6</a>). But if we suppose the Devil of Luther&rsquo;s
Bible (<a href="#v2fig17">Fig. 17</a>) to be the one at which the
inkstand was thrown, the criticism is correct. The two pictures
mentioned may be instructively compared. Luther&rsquo;s Devil is the
reply of the University to the Church. These are the two
devils&mdash;the priest and the scholar&mdash;who glared at each other
in the early sixteenth century. &lsquo;The Devil smelled the
roast,&rsquo; says Luther, &lsquo;that if the languages revived, his
kingdom would get a hole which he could not easily stop again.&rsquo;
And it must be admitted that some of the monkish execrations of the
time, indeed of many times since, have an undertone of Jahvistic
jealousy. &lsquo;These Knowers will become as one of us.&rsquo; It must
also be admitted that the clerical instinct told true: the University
man held in him that sceptical devil who is always the destroyer of the
priest&rsquo;s paradise. These two devils which struggled with each
other through the sixteenth century still wage their war in the arena
of Protestantism. Many a Lutheran now living may remember to have
smiled when Hofmann&rsquo;s experiments in discovering carbonic acid
gas gained him repute for raising again Mephosto; but perhaps they did
not recognise <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb287" href="#v2pb287"
name="v2pb287">287</a>]</span>Luther&rsquo;s devil when, at the annual
assembly of Lutheran Pastors in Berlin (Sept. 1877), he reappeared as
the Rev. Professor Grau, and said, &lsquo;Not a few listen to those
striving to combine Christ with Belial, to reconcile redeeming truth
with modern science and culture.&rsquo; But though they who take the
name of Luther in vain may thus join hands with the Devil, at whom the
Reformer threw his inkstand, the combat will still go on, and the
University Belial do the brave work of Bel till beneath his feet lies
the dragon of Darkness whether disguised as Pope or Protestant.</p>
<p>If the Church wishes to know precisely how far the roughness
pardonable in the past survives unpardonably in itself, let its clergy
peruse carefully the following translation by Mr. Leland of a poem by
Heine; and realise that the Devil portrayed in it is, by grace of its
own prelates, at present the most admired personage in every Court and
fashionable drawing-room in Christendom.</p>

Tertullian&rsquo;s phrase, &lsquo;The Devil is God&rsquo;s Ape,&rsquo;
became popular at one time, and the Ape-devil had frequent
representation in art&mdash;as, for instance, in Holbein&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Crucifixion&rsquo; (1477), now at Augsburg, where a Devil with
head of an ape, bat-wings, and flaming red legs is carrying off the
soul of the impenitent thief. The same subject is found in the same
gallery in an Altdorfer, where the Devil&rsquo;s face is that of a
gorilla.</p>

famous ones the consistency with which the first christians had
developed the doctrine that nature is the incarnation of the Evil
Spirit. It reports to us the sense of many sounds and sights which were
heard and seen by ears and eyes trained for such and no other, all
showing that the genii of nature and beauty were vanishing from the
earth. Over the &AElig;gean sea were heard lamentations and the voice,
&lsquo;Great Pan is dead!&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb289"

<p class="first">But while the rage of these Fathers towards all the
great gods and goddesses, who in their grand temples represented
&lsquo;the pride of life,&rsquo; was remorseless, they were
comparatively indifferent to the belief or disbelief of the lower
classes in their small tutelary divinities. They appear almost to have
encouraged belief in these, perhaps appreciating the advantages of the
popular custom of giving generous offerings to such personal and
domestic patrons. At a very early period there seems to have arisen an
idea of converting these more plebeian spirits into guardian angels
with christian names. Thus Jerome relates in his Life of the first
Hermit Paul, that when St. Anthony was on his way to visit that holy
man, he encountered a Centaur who pointed out the way; and next a
human-like dwarf with horns, hooked fingers, and feet like those of a
goat. St. Anthony believing this to be an apparition of the Devil, made
the sign of the Cross; but the little man, nowise troubled by this,
respectfully approached the monk, and having been asked who he was,
answered: &lsquo;I am a mortal, and one of those inhabitants of the
Desert whom the Gentiles in their error worship under the names of
Fauns, Satyrs, and Incubi: I am delegated by my people to ask of thee
to pray for us to our common God, who we know has descended for the
salvation of the world, and whose praises resound in all the
earth.&rsquo; At this glorification of Christ St. Anthony was
transported with joy, and turning towards Alexandria he cried,
&lsquo;Woe to thee, adulterous city, which adorest animals as
gods!&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb290" href="#v2pb290"
name="v2pb290">290</a>]</span></p>
<p>Perhaps the evolution of these desert demons into good christians
would have gone on more rapidly and completely if the primitive
theologians had known as much of their history as comparative mythology
has disclosed to the modern world. St. Anthony was, however, fairly on
the track of them when he turned towards Alexandria. Egypt appears to
have been the especial centre from which were distributed through the
world the fetish guardians of provinces, towns, households and
individuals. Their Serapes reappear in the Teraphim of Laban, and many
of the forms they used reappear in the Penates, Lares, and genii of
Latin countries. All these in their several countries were originally
related to its ancient religion or mythology, but before the christian
era they were very much the same in Egypt, Greece, and Italy. They were
shaped in many different, but usually natural forms, such as serpents,
dogs, boys, and old men, though often some intimation was given of
their demonic character. They were so multiplied that even plants and
animals had their guardians. The anthropomorphic genii called the
Patrii, who were supposed to preside over provinces, were generally
represented bearing weapons with which they defended the regions of
which they were patrons. These were the Averrunci or
Apotrop&aelig;i.</p>
<p>There are many interesting branches of this subject which cannot be
entered into here, and others have already been considered in the
foregoing parts of this work. It is sufficient for my present purpose
to remark, that, in the course of time, all the households of the world
had traditional guardians; these were generally represented in some
shape on amulets and talismans, on which were commonly inscribed the
verbal charms by which the patron could be summoned. In the process of
further time the amulets&mdash;especially such as were reproduced by
tribes migrating <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb291" href="#v2pb291"
name="v2pb291">291</a>]</span>from the vicinity of good
engravers&mdash;might be marked only with the verbal charms; these
again were, in the end, frequently represented only by some word or
name. This was the &lsquo;spell.&rsquo; Imagination fails in the effort
to conceive how many strata of extinct deities had bequeathed to the
ancient Egyptians those mystical names whose exact utterance they
believed would constrain each god so named to appear and bind him to
serve the invoker&rsquo;s purpose whether good or evil.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e12874src" href="#xd20e12874" name=
"xd20e12874src">2</a> This idea continued among the Jews and shaped the
commandment, &lsquo;Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in
vain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was in these diminutive forms that great systems survived among
the common people. Amid natural convulsions ancient formations of faith
were broken into fragments; in the ebb and flow of time these fragments
were smoothed, as it were, into these talismanic pebbles. Yet each of
these conveyed all the virtue which had been derived from the great and
costly ceremonial system from which it originally crumbled; the virtue
of soothing the mind and calming the nerves of sufferers with the
feeling that, though they might have been assailed by hostile powers,
they had friendly powers too who were active in their
behalf&mdash;Vindicators, to recall Job&rsquo;s phrase&mdash;who at
last would stand by them to the end. In the further ebb and flow of
generations the mass of such charms are further pulverised into sand or
into mud; but not all of them: amid the mud will be found many
surviving specimens, and such mud of accumulated superstitions is
always susceptible of being remoulded after such lingering models,
should occasion demand.</p>
<p>Erasmus, in his &lsquo;Adages,&rsquo; suggests that it was from
these genii of &lsquo;the Gentiles&rsquo; that the christians derived
their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb292" href="#v2pb292" name=
"v2pb292">292</a>]</span>notion of each person being attended by two
angels, a good and a bad. Probably he was but half right. The peoples
to whom he refers did not generally believe that each man was attended
by a bad spirit, a personal enemy. That was an honour reserved for
individuals particularly formidable to the evil powers,&mdash;Adam,
Jacob, Hercules, or Zoroaster. The one preternatural power attending
each ordinary individual defended him from the general forces of evil.
But it was Christianity which, in the gradual effort to substitute
patron-saints and guardian-angels of its own for the pagan genii,
turned the latter from friends to enemies, and their protecting into
assailing weapons.</p>
<p>All the hereditary household gods of what is now called Christendom
were diabolised. But in order that the masses might turn from them and
invoke christian guardians, the Penates, Lares, and genii had to be
belittled on the one hand, and the superior power of the saints and
angels demonstrated. When Christianity had gained the throne of
political power, it was easy to show that the &lsquo;imps,&rsquo; as
the old guardians were now called, could no longer protect their
invokers from christian punishment, or confer equal favours.</p>
<p>Christianity conquered Europe by the sword, but at first that sword
was not wielded against the humble masses. It was wielded against their
proud oppressors. To the common people it brought glad tidings of a new
order, in which, under the banner of a crucified working-man and his
(alleged) peasant mother, all caste should disappear but that of piety
and charity. Christ eating with publicans and sinners and healing the
wayside cripples reappeared in St. Martin dividing his embroidered
cloak with a beggar&mdash;type of a new aristocracy. They who
worshipped the Crucified Peasant in the rock-cave of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb293" href="#v2pb293" name=
"v2pb293">293</a>]</span>Tours which St. Martin had consecrated, or in
little St. Martin&rsquo;s Church at Canterbury where Bertha was
baptized, could not see the splendid cathedrals now visible from them,
built of their bones and cemented with their blood. King Ethelbert
surrendered the temple of his idol to the consecration of Augustine,
and his baptized subjects had no difficulty in seeing the point of the
ejected devil&rsquo;s talons on the wall which he assailed when the
first mass was therein celebrated.</p>
<p>Glad tidings to the poor were these that the persecuted first
missionaries brought to Gaul, Britain, and Germany. But they did not
last. The christians and the pagan princes, like Herod and Pilate,
joined hands to crucify the European peasant, and he was reduced to a
worse serfdom than he had suffered before. Every humble home in Europe
was trampled in the mire in the name of Christ. The poor man&rsquo;s
wife and child, and all he possessed were victims of the workman of
Jerusalem turned destroyer of his brethren. Michelet has well traced
Witchcraft to the Despair of the Middle Ages.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e12894src" href="#xd20e12894" name="xd20e12894src">3</a> The decay
of the old religions, which Christianity had made too rapid for it to
be complete, had left, as we have seen, all the trains laid for that
terrible explosion; and now its own hand of cruelty brought the torch
to ignite them. Let us, at risk of some iteration, consider some of
these combustible elements.</p>

pagan gods and <span class="corr" id="xd20e12907" title=

popular mind a sceptical habit, and also having use for them to excite
terror. Having for this latter purpose carved and painted them as ugly
and bestial, it became further of importance that they should be
represented as stupid and comparatively impotent. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb294" href="#v2pb294" name=

put thousands of them to flight. This tuition was not difficult. The
peasantries of Europe had readily been induced to associate the newly
announced (christian) Devil with their most mischievous demons. But we
have already considered the forces under which these demons had entered
on their decline before they were associated with Satan. Many conquered
obstructions had rendered the Demons which represented them ridiculous.
Hence the &lsquo;Dummeteufel&rsquo; of so many German fables and of the
medi&aelig;val miracle-plays. &lsquo;No greater proof,&rsquo; says Dr.
Dasent, &lsquo;can be given of the small hold which the christian Devil
has taken of the Norse mind, than the heathen aspect under which he
constantly appears, and the ludicrous way in which he is always
outwitted.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e12912src" href=

up to ridicule. It is not difficult to imagine the process of evolution
by which the horns of such insignificant devils turned to the asinine
ears of such devils as this stall carving at Corbeil, near Paris
(<a href="#v2fig19">Fig. 19</a>), which represented the popular view
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb295" href="#v2pb295" name=
"v2pb295">295</a>]</span>of the mastery obtained by witches over
devils. It must be remembered also that this power over devils was in
accordance with the traditions concerning Solomon, and the subserviency
of Oriental demons generally to the lamps or charms to which they were
bound.</p>

<p>What the popular christian devil had become in all the Northern
nations is sufficiently shown in the figure he presented in most of the
old miracle-plays and &lsquo;Moralities.&rsquo; &lsquo;The Devill in
his fethers all ragged and rent,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e12939src" href="#xd20e12939" name="xd20e12939src">6</a> had
horns, wide mouth, long (sometimes up-turned) nose, red beard, cloven
foot, and tail. He was attended by a buffoon called Vice.
&lsquo;And,&rsquo; says Harsenet, &lsquo;it was a pretty part in the
old Church playes when the nimble Vice would skip up nimbly like a
Jackanapes into the Devil&rsquo;s necke, and ride the Devil a course,
and belabour him with a wooden dagger, till he made him roar, whereat
the people would laugh to see the Devil so
Vice-haunted.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e12942src" href=
"#xd20e12942" name="xd20e12942src">7</a> The two must have nearly
resembled the clown and his unhappy victim Pantaloon in our pantomimes,
as to their antics. It would seem that sometimes holy personages were
caricatured in the make-up of the stage-devil. Thus in &lsquo;Gammer
Gurton&rsquo;s Needle&rsquo; we have this conversation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">In the scene of Christ&rsquo;s delivering souls from
purgatory, the Devil is represented as blowing lustily a horn to alarm
his comrades, and crying, &lsquo;Out, out, aronzt!&rsquo; to the
invader. He fights with a three-pronged fork. He and his victims are
painted black,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e12967src" href="#xd20e12967"
name="xd20e12967src">8</a> in contrast with the souls of the saved,
which are white. The hair was considered very important.<a class=

<p>The insignificance to which the priests had reduced the devil in the
plays, where they were usually the actors, reflected their own petty
routine of life. They could conceive of nothing more terrible than
their own mean mishaps and local obstructions. One great office of the
Devil was to tempt some friar to sleep when he should be at
prayer,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e13002src" href="#xd20e13002" name=
"xd20e13002src">11</a> make another drink too much, or a third cast
warm glances at a village beauty. The <i>Revelations</i> of the Abbot
Richalmus, written seven hundred years ago, shows the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb297" href="#v2pb297" name=
"v2pb297">297</a>]</span>Devil already far gone in his process of
diminution. The Devil here concentrates the energies which once made
the earth tremble on causing nausea to the Abbot, and making the choir
cough while he is preaching. &lsquo;When I sit down to holy
studies,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;the devils make me heavy with sleep.
Then I stretch my hands beyond my cuffs to give them a chill. Forthwith
the spirits prick me under my clothes like so many fleas, which causes
me to put my hands on them; and so they get warm again, and my reading
grows careless.&rsquo; &lsquo;Come, just look at my lip; for twenty
years has an imp clung to it just to make it hang down.&rsquo; It is
ludicrous to find that ancient characteristic of the gods of Death
already adverted to&mdash;their hatred of salt, the agent of
preservation&mdash;descended from being the sign of Job&rsquo;s
constancy to Jehovah into a mere item of the Abbot&rsquo;s appetite.
&lsquo;When I am at dinner, and the devil has taken away my appetite,
as soon as I have tasted a little salt it comes back to me; and if,
shortly afterwards, I lose it again, I take some more salt, and am once
more an hungered.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e13010src" href=
"#xd20e13010" name="xd20e13010src">12</a></p>
<p>One dangerous element was the contempt into which, by many causes,
the infernal powers had been brought. But a more dangerous one lay in
another direction. Though the current phrases of the New Testament and
of the Fathers of the Church, declaring this world, its wealth, loves,
and pleasures, to be all the kingdom of Satan, had become cant in the
mouths of priests ruling over Europe, it had never been cant to the
humble peasantries. Although they had degraded many devils imported by
the priests, it had been in connection with the declining terrors of
their native demonologies. But above these degraded and hated gnomes
and elves, whose <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb298" href="#v2pb298"
name="v2pb298">298</a>]</span>paternity had been transferred from
S&oelig;tere to Satan, there was an array of beautiful
deities&mdash;gentle gods and goddesses traditionally revered and loved
as protectors of the home and the family&mdash;which had never really
lost their hold on the common people. They might have shrunk before the
aggressive victories of the Saints into little Fairies, but their
continued love for the poor and the oppressed was the romance of every
household. What did these good fairies do? They sometimes loaded the
lowly with wealth, if summoned in just the right way; they sang secrets
to them from trees as little birds, they smoothed the course of love,
clothed ash-maidens in fine clothes, transported people through the
air, enabled them to render themselves invulnerable, or invisible, to
get out of prisons, to vanquish &lsquo;the powers that be,&rsquo;
whether &lsquo;ordained of God&rsquo; or not. Now all these were
benefits which, by christian theory, could only be conferred by that
Prince of this World who ministered to &lsquo;the pride of
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Into homes which the priest and his noble had stripped of happiness
and hope,&mdash;whose loving brides were for baptized Bluebeards, whose
hard earnings were taken as the price of salvation from devils whose
awfulness was departing,&mdash;there came from afar rumours of great
wealth and splendour conferred upon their worshippers by Eastern gods
and goddesses. The priests said all those were devils who would torture
their devotees eternally after death; yet it could not be denied that
the Moors had the secret of lustres and ornamentation, that the heathen
East was gorgeous, that all Christendom was dreaming of the wealth of
Ormus and of Ind. Granted that Satan had come westward and northward,
joined the scurvy crew of Loki, and become of little importance; but
what of Baal or Beelzebub, of Asmodeus, of the genii who built
Solomon&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb299" href="#v2pb299"
name="v2pb299">299</a>]</span>temple, of rich Pluto, of august Ahriman?
Along with stories of Oriental magnificence there spread through
Christendom names of many deities and demons; many of them beautiful
names, too, euphemism having generally managed to bestow melodious
epithets alike on deities feared and loved. In Faust&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Miraculous Art and Book of Marvels, or the Black Raven&rsquo;
(1469), the infernal heirarchy are thus named:&mdash;<i>King</i>,
Lucifer; <i>Viceroy</i>, Belial; <i>Gubernatores</i>, Satan, Beelzebub,
Astaroth, Pluto; <i>Chief Princes</i>, Aziel, Mephistopheles, Marbuel,
Ariel, Aniguel, Anisel, Barfael. Seductive meanings, too, corresponding
to these names, had filtered in some way from the high places they once
occupied into the minds of the people. Lucifer was a fallen star that
might rise again; Belial and Beelzebub were princes of the fire that
rendered possible the arts of man, and the Belfires never went out in
the cold North; Astarte meant beauty, and Pluto wealth; Aziel (Asael)
was President of the great College of occult arts, from whom Solomon
learned the secrets by which he made the jinni his slaves; Marbuel was
the artist and mechanic, sometimes believed to aid artisans who
produced work beyond ordinary human skill; Ariel was the fine spirit of
the air whose intelligence corresponded to that of the Holy Ghost on
the other side; Aniguel is the serpent of Paradise, generally written
Anisel; Anizazel is probably a fanciful relative of Azazel, &lsquo;the
strong god;&rsquo; and Barfael, who in a later Faust book is Barbuel,
is an orientalised form of the &lsquo;demon of the long beard&rsquo;
who holds the secret of the philosopher&rsquo;s stone.</p>
<p>In a later chapter the growth of favourable views of the devil is
considered. Some of the legends therein related may be instructively
read in connection with the development of Witchcraft. Many rumours
were spread abroad of kindly assistance brought by demons to persons
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb300" href="#v2pb300" name=
"v2pb300">300</a>]</span>in distress. But even more than by hopes so
awakened was the witch aided by the burning desire of the people for
vengeance. They wanted Zamiel (Sama&euml;l) to help them to mould the
bullet that would not miss its mark. The Devil and all his angels had
long been recognised by their catechists as being utilised by the Deity
to execute his vengeance on the guilty; and to serfs in their agony
that devil who would not spare prince or priest was more desired than
even the bestower of favours to their starving minds and bodies.</p>
<p>Under the long ages of war in Europe, absorbing the energies of men,
women had become the preservers of letters. The era of witchcraft in
Europe found that sex alone able to read and write, arts disesteemed in
men, among the peasantry at least. To them men turned when it had
become a priestly lesson that a few words were more potent than the
weapons of princes. Besides this, women were the chief sorcerers,
because they were the chief sufferers. In Alsace (1615), out of
seventy-five who perished as witches, sixty-two were women. The famous
<i>Malleus Maleficorum</i>, which did more evil than any work ever
published, derives <i>femina</i> from <i>fide minus</i>. Although in
the Faust legend Mephistopheles objects to marriage, many stories
represent diabolical weddings. Particular details were told of the
marriage of Satan with the daughter of a Sorceress at Egnischen (1585),
on which occasion the three towers of the castle there were said to
have been illuminated, and a splendid banquet spread, the favourite
dish being a ragout of bats. There was exquisite music, and a
&lsquo;beautiful man&rsquo; blessed the nuptials. How many poor peasant
girls must have had such dreams as they looked up from their drudgery
to the brilliant chateaux?</p>
<div class="figure xd20e13055width" id="v2fig20"><img src=

height="456">
<p class="figureHead">Fig. 20.&mdash;<span class="sc">Lilith as
Cat.</span></p>
</div>
<p>In the illuminated manuscript known as &lsquo;Queen Mary&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb301" href="#v2pb301" name=
"v2pb301">301</a>]</span>Psalter&rsquo; (1553) there is a picture of
the Fall of Man (<a href="#v2fig20">Fig. 20</a>) which possesses
far-reaching significance. It is a modification of that idea, which
gained such wide currency in the Middle Ages, that it was the
serpent-woman Lilith who had tempted Adam to eat the forbidden fruit.
In this picture, while the beautiful face and ample hair of Lilith are
given, instead of the usual female bust she has the body of a cat. This
nocturnal animal, already sacred to Freyja, the Teutonic Venus, whose
chariot it drew, gained a new mythological career in the North by the
large number of Southern and Oriental stones which related it to the
lunar and amorous demonesses. When the gods fled before the Titans,
Diana, as Ovid relates, changed herself to a cat, and as infernal
Hecate that animal was still beside her. If my reader will turn to
<a href="#v1pb130">vol. i. p. 130</a>, some of the vast number of myths
which prepared the cat to take its place as familiar of the witch may
be found. Whether the artist had Lilith in his mind or not, the
illumination in &lsquo;Queen Mary&rsquo;s Psalter&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb302" href="#v2pb302" name=
"v2pb302">302</a>]</span>represents a remarkable association of myths.
For Lilith was forerunner of the medi&aelig;val mothers weeping for
their children; her voice of perpetual lamentation at the cruel fate
allotted her by the combined tyranny of God and man was heard on every
sighing wind; and she was the richly dressed bride of the Prince of
Devils, ever seeking to tempt youth. Such stories floated through the
mind of the Middle Ages, and this infernal Madonna is here seen in
association with the cat, beneath whose soft sparkling fur the goddess
of Love and Beauty was supposed to be still lurking near the fireside
of many a miserable home. Some fragrance of the mystical East was with
this feline beauty, and nothing can be more striking than the contrast
which the ordinary devils beside her present. Their unseductive
ugliness and meanness is placed out of sight of the pair tempted to
seek the fruit of forbidden knowledge. They inspire the man and woman
in their evidently eager grasping after the fruit, which here means the
consultation of fair fortune-tellers and witches to obtain that occult
knowledge for which speculative men are seeking in secret studies and
laboratories.</p>
<p>Those who have paid attention to the subject of Witchcraft need not
be reminded that its complexity and vastness would require a larger
volume than the present to deal with it satisfactorily. The present
study must be limited to a presentation of some of the facts which
induce the writer to believe that, beneath the phenomena, lay a
profound alienation from Christianity, and an effort to recall the
banished gods which it had superseded.</p>
<p>The first christian church was mainly Jewish, and this is also to
say that it inherited the vast Angelolatry and the system of spells
which that tribe had brought from Babylon. To all this was now
superadded the accumulation of Assyrian and Egyptian lore which was
re-edited in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb303" href="#v2pb303"
name="v2pb303">303</a>]</span>form of Neoplatonicism. This mongrel
mass, constituted of notions crumbled from many systems, acquired a
certain consistency in Gnosticism. The ancient Egyptians had colleges
set apart for astrological study, and for cultivation of the art of
healing by charms. Every month, decade, day of the year had its special
guardian in the heavens. The popular festivals were astronomic. To the
priests in the colleges were reserved study of the sacred books in
which the astrological secrets were contained, and whose authorship was
attributed to the god Thoth, inventor of writing, the Greek Hermes,
and, later, Egyptian Hermes Trismegistus. The zodiac is a memorial of
the influence which the stars were supposed to exert upon the human
body. Alchemy (the word is Egyptian, <i>K&eacute;mi</i> meaning
&lsquo;black earth&rsquo;) was also studied in connection with solar,
lunar, and stellar influences. The Alchemists dreamed of discovering
the philosopher&rsquo;s stone, which would change base metals to gold;
and Diocletian, in burning the Alchemists&rsquo; books, believed that,
in so doing, he would deprive the Egyptians of their source of
wealth.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e13082src" href="#xd20e13082" name=
"xd20e13082src">13</a></p>
<p>Imported into Greece, these notions and their cult had a twofold
development. Among the Platonists they turned to a naturalistic and
allegorical Demonology; among the uncultivated they formed a
Diabolarchy, which gathered around the terrible lunar
phantasm&mdash;Hecate.</p>
<p>The astrological College of Egypt gave to the Jews their strange
idea of the high school maintained among the devils, already referred
to in connection with Asmodeus, who was one of its leading professors.
The rabbinical legend was, that two eminent angels, Asa and Asael,
remonstrated with the Creator on having formed man only to give
trouble. The Creator said they would have done the same as man under
similar circumstances; whereupon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb304"
href="#v2pb304" name="v2pb304">304</a>]</span>Asa and Asael proposed
that the experiment should be tried. They went to earth, and the
Creator&rsquo;s prediction was fulfilled: they were the first
&lsquo;sons of God&rsquo; who fell in love with the daughters of men
(Gen. vi. 2). They were then embodied. In heaven they had been angels
of especial knowledge in divine arts, and they now used their spells to
reascend. But their sin rendered the spells powerless for that, so they
repaired to the Dark Mountains, and there established a great College
of Sorcery. Among the many distinguished graduates of this College were
Job, Jethro, and Bileam. It was believed that these three instructed
the soothsayers who attempted to rival the miracles of Moses before
Pharaoh. Job and Jethro were subsequently converted, but Bileam
continued his hostility to Israel, and remains a teacher in the
College. Through knowledge of the supreme spell&mdash;the
<i>Shem-hammphor&aacute;sch</i>, or real name of God&mdash;Solomon was
able to chain Professor Asmodeus, and wrest from him the secret of the
worm Sch&aacute;mir, by whose aid the Temple was built.</p>
<p>Traditions of the learning of the Egyptians, and of the marvels
learned by Solomon from Asa and Asael by which he compelled demons to
serve him, and the impressive story of the Witch of Endor, powerfully
influenced the inquisitive minds of Europe. The fierce denunciations of
all studies of these arts of sorcery by the early Church would alone
reveal how prevalent they were. The wonderful story of Apollonius of
Tyana,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e13099src" href="#xd20e13099" name=
"xd20e13099src">14</a> as told by Philostratus, was really a kind of
gospel to the more worldly-minded scholars. Some rabbins, following the
outcry against Jesus, &lsquo;He casteth out devils by Beelzebub,&rsquo;
circulated at an early date the story that Jesus had derived his power
to work miracles from the spell <i>Shem-hammphor&aacute;sch</i>,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb305" href="#v2pb305" name=
"v2pb305">305</a>]</span>which he found on one of the stones of the
Temple where Solomon had left it. Though Eusebius cast doubt upon them,
the christians generally do not appear to have denied the miracles of
Apollonius, which precisely copy those of Jesus from the miraculous
birth to the ascension, but even to have quoted them as an evidence of
the possibility of miracles. Celsus having attributed the miracles of
Jesus to sorcery, and said that magic influenced only the ignorant and
immoral, Origen replies that, in order to convince himself of the
contrary, he has only to read the memoirs of Apollonius by
M&aelig;ragenes, who speaks of him as a philosopher and magician, who
repeatedly exercised his powers on philosophers. Arnobius and the
fathers of the fourth century generally believed in the Apollonian
thaumaturgy and attributed it to magic. Aldus Manutius published the
book of Philostratus in the fifteenth century, and the degree to which
the fascinating and marvellous stories concerning Apollonius fired the
European imagination just awaking under the breath of the Renaissance,
may be estimated by the fury with which the &lsquo;magician&rsquo; was
anathematised by Pico della Mirandola, Jean Bodin, and Baronius. The
book and the controversy attracted much attention, and while the
priests still continued to charge Apollonius with being a
&lsquo;magician,&rsquo; they appear to have perceived that it would
have been more to the point, so far as their real peril was concerned,
to have proved him an impostor. Failing that, Dr. Faustus and his
fellow-professors in the &lsquo;black art&rsquo; were left masters of
the situation. The people had to digest the facts admitted, that a
Pagan had learned, by initiations into the astrological schools of
Egypt and India, the means of healing the sick, raising the dead,
flying through the air, throwing off chains, opening locks, rendering
himself invisible, and discerning the future. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb306" href="#v2pb306" name=
"v2pb306">306</a>]</span></p>
<p>There was a call for some kind of Apollonius, and Faustus arose.
Side by side flourished Luther and Faustus. To Roman Catholic eyes they
were twin sons of the Devil;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e13110src" href=
"#xd20e13110" name="xd20e13110src">15</a> that they were characteristic
products of one moral age and force appears to me certain, even as
to-day the negations of Science and the revival of
&lsquo;Spiritualism&rsquo; have a common root in radical disbelief of
the hereditary dogmas and forms of so-called religion. It is, however,
not surprising that Protestantism felt as much horror of its bastard
brother as Science has of the ghostly seances. Through the early
sixteenth century we can trace this strange Dr. Faustus
(&lsquo;auspicious,&rsquo; he had chosen that name) going about
Germany, not omitting Erfurth, and talking in taverns about his magic
arts and powers. More is said of him in the following chapter; it is
sufficient to observe here, and it is the conclusion of Professor
Morley, who has sifted the history with his usual care, that about him,
as a centre of crystallisation, tales ascribed in the first place to
other conjurers arranged themselves, until he became the popular ideal
of one who sought to sound the depths of this world&rsquo;s knowledge
and enjoyments without help from the Church or its God. The priests did
not doubt that this could be done, nor did the Protestants; they
generally agreed that it could be accomplished at cost of the soul. As
angels of the good God must answer to the formulas of invocation to
those who had made a sacramental compact with their Chief, so was it
possible to share a sacrament of Satan, and by certain invocations
summon his infernal angels to obtain the pleasures of this world of
which he is Prince. A thousand years&rsquo; experience of the Church
had left the poor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb307" href=
"#v2pb307" name="v2pb307">307</a>]</span>ready to sign the compact if
they could secure some little earthly joy. As for Heaven, if it were
anything like what its ministers had provided for the poor on earth,
Hell might be preferable after all.</p>
<p>Dr. Wuttke, while writing his recent work on German superstitions,
was surprised to learn that there still exist in France and in
Wurtemberg schools for teaching the Black Art. A priest in the
last-named country wrote him that a boy had confessed to having passed
the lower grade of such a school, but, scared by the horrid ceremonies,
had pronounced some holy words which destroyed the effect of the wicked
practices, and struck the assembled Devil-worshippers with
consternation. The boy said he had barely escaped with his life. I have
myself passed an evening at a school in London &lsquo;for the
development of Spirit-mediums,&rsquo; and possibly Dr. Wuttke&rsquo;s
correspondent would describe these also as Devil-worshippers. No doubt
all such circles might be traced arch&aelig;ologically to that
Sorcerers&rsquo; College said by the rabbins to have been kept by Asa
and Asael. But what moral force preserved them? They do but represent a
turning of methods made familiar by the Church to coax benefits from
other supernatural powers in the hope that they would be less dilatory
than the Trinity in bestowing their gifts. What is the difference
between St. Wolfram&rsquo;s God and King Radbot&rsquo;s Devil? The one
offers a golden mansion on earth warranted to last through eternity,
the other a like mansion in the skies receivable after death. The Saint
agrees that if Radbot&rsquo;s Devil can build him such a house the king
would be quite right to worship the architect. The question of the
comparative moral merits of the two invisible Powers is not mentioned.
This legend, related in a preceding chapter, is characteristic of the
motives to which the priesthood appealed through the Middle Ages.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb308" href="#v2pb308" name=
"v2pb308">308</a>]</span>It is no wonder that the people began to
appeal to the gods of their traditional Radbots, nor that they should
have used the ceremonial and sacramental formulas around them.</p>
<p>But to these were added other formulas borrowed from different
sources. The &lsquo;Compact with the Devil&rsquo; had in it various
elements. It appears to have been a custom of the Odinistic religion
for men to sign acts of self-dedication to trusted deities, somewhat
corresponding to the votive tablets of Southern religion. It was a
legend of Odin that when dying he marked his arm with the point of a
spear, and this may have been imitated. In the &lsquo;Mysteries&rsquo;
of pagan and christian systems blood played an important part&mdash;the
human blood of earlier times being symbolised by that of animals, and
ultimately, among christians, in wine of the Eucharist. The primitive
history of this blood-covenant is given in another chapter. Some
astrological formulas, and many of the deities invoked, spread through
Europe with the Jews. The actual, and quite as often fabulous, wealth
of that antichristian race was ascribed to Antichrist, and while
christian princes thought of such gold as legitimate spoil, the honest
peasants sought from their astrologers the transmitted &lsquo;key of
Solomon,&rsquo; in virtue of which the demons served him. The famous
&lsquo;Compact&rsquo; therefore was largely of christian-judaic origin,
and only meant conveyance of the soul in consideration of precisely the
same treasures as those promised by the Church to all whose names were
written in the Lamb&rsquo;s Book,&mdash;the only difference being in
the period when redemption of the respective issues of priest and
astrologer should fall due. One was payable during this life, the other
after death.</p>
<p>The ceremonial performances of Witchcraft have also always existed
in some form. What we are familiar with <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb309" href="#v2pb309" name="v2pb309">309</a>]</span>of late as
Spirit-seances are by no means new. More than a hundred years ago, Mr.
Wesley and various clergymen were sitting at a table in Cock Lane,
asking the spirit &lsquo;Fanny&rsquo; to rap twice if she were
&lsquo;in a state of progressive happiness.&rsquo; Nay, a hundred years
before that (1661), Sir Thomas Chamberlain and others, sitting in a
haunted house at Tedworth, Wilts, asked &lsquo;Satan, if the Drummer
set thee to work, give three knocks, and no more, which it did very
distinctly, and stopped.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e13129src"
href="#xd20e13129" name="xd20e13129src">16</a> We also learn that, in
another town and case (1654), &lsquo;a naked arm and hand appeared and
beat the floor.&rsquo; It would not be difficult to go further back and
find that the dark circle of our Spiritualists with much of its
apparatus has existed continuously through the Middle Ages. The dark
seance which Goethe has represented in Faust, Part II., at which the
spirits of Helen and Paris are evoked, is a very accurate picture of
the &lsquo;materialisations&rsquo; now exhibited by mediums, more than
forty years after its publication. These outer resemblances are
physiognomical. The seance of to-day has lost the darker features of
its medi&aelig;val prototype, because the Present has not a real and
temporal, but only a speculative and sentimental despair, and this is
the kind that possesses chiefly the well-to-do and idle classes. It is
not difficult to meet the eye of our everyday human nature amid those
frenzied periods when whole districts seemed afflicted with epidemic
madness, and look deep in that eye to the fathomless heart of
humanity.</p>
<p>In an old parish register of Fewston, Yorkshire, are the following
entries:&mdash;&lsquo;1621. Anne, daughter of Edward Fairfax, baptized
the 12th June.&rsquo; &lsquo;1621. Edward Fairfax, Esq., a child named
Anne, buried the 9th October.&rsquo; Then in the History of
Knaresborough we read of this child, &lsquo;She was held to have died
through witchcraft.&rsquo; In what <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb310" href="#v2pb310" name="v2pb310">310</a>]</span>dreams did that
child, supposed to have been snatched away by diabolic malice, return
as a pure spirit uplifted in light, yet shadowed by the anxiety and
pain of the bereaved family! A medium is at hand, one through whose
mind and heart all the stormy electricities of the time are playing.
The most distinguished representative of the Fairfax family is off
fighting for Parliament against the King. Edward Fairfax is a zealous
Churchman. His eldest daughter, Helen, aged twenty-one, is a
parishioner of the Rev. Mr. Smithson, yet she has come under the strong
influence of a Nonconformist preacher, Mr. Cook. The scholarly
clergyman and his worldly Church on one side, and the ignorant minister
with his humble followers on the other, are unconscious
personifications of Vice and Virtue, while between them poor Helen is
no Heraklea.</p>
<p>Nineteen days after the burial of her little sister Anne, as
mentioned above, Helen is found &lsquo;in a deadly trance.&rsquo; After
a little she begins to speak, her words showing that she is, by
imagination, &lsquo;in the church at Leeds, hearing a sermon by Mr.
Cook.&rsquo; On November 3, as she lies on her bed, Helen exclaims,
&lsquo;A white cat hath been long upon me and drawn my breath, and hath
left in my mouth and throat so filthy a smell that it doth poison
me!&rsquo; Next we have the following in the father&rsquo;s diary:
&lsquo;<i>Item.</i> Upon Wednesday, the 14th of November, she saw a
black dog by her bedside, and, after a little sleep, she had an
apparition of one like a young gentleman, very brave, his apparel all
laid with gold lace, a hat with a golden band, and a ruff in fashion.
He did salute her with the same compliment as she said Sir Fernandino
Fairfax useth when he cometh to the house and saluteth her mother....
He said he was a Prince, and would make her Queen of England and of all
the world if she would go with him. She refused, and said, &lsquo;In
the name of God, what art thou?&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb311" href="#v2pb311" name="v2pb311">311</a>]</span>He presently
did forbid her to name God; to which she replied, &lsquo;Thou art no
man if thou canst not abide the name of God; but if thou be a man, come
near, let me feel of thee;&rsquo; which he would not do, but said,
&lsquo;It is no matter for feeling.&rsquo; She proceeded, &lsquo;If
thou wert a man, thou wouldst not deny to be felt; but thou art the
devil, and art but a shadow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is possible that Helen Fairfax had read in Shakspere&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Lear,&rsquo; printed twelve years before, that</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The Prince of Darkness is a gentleman;</p>
<p class="line">Modo he&rsquo;s called, and Mahu.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e13150src" href="#xd20e13150" name="xd20e13150src">17</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">But the reader will remark how her vision anticipates
that of Faust, the transformation of the poodle to finely-dressed
Mephistopheles. On the next apparition a bit from Patmos is
interpolated, the Devil appearing as a beast with many horns; but the
folklore of Yorkshire prevails, and &lsquo;presently he was like a very
little dog, and desired her to open her mouth and let him come into her
body, and then he would rule all the world.&rsquo; Lastly, he
&lsquo;filled the room with fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the account thus far we have the following items of ancient
mythology:&mdash;1, the Cat; 2, the Dog; 3, the Pride of Life
(Asmodeus), represented in the fine dress and manners of the fiend; 4,
the Prince of this World, offering its throne; 5, the Egyptian belief
in potency of the Name; 6, the Hunger-Demon, who dares not be felt,
because his back is hollow, and, though himself a shadow, casts none;
7, the disembodied devil of the rabbins, who seeks to enter a human
form, in order to enjoy the higher powers of which man is capable; 8,
the fiend of fire.</p>
<p>The period in which Helen Fairfax lived supplied forms <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb312" href="#v2pb312" name=
"v2pb312">312</a>]</span>for the &lsquo;materialisation&rsquo; of these
notions flitting from the ancient cemeteries of theology. The gay and
gallant Asmodeus had been transformed into a goat under the ascetic eye
of Europe; his mistress is a naked witch; her familiar and slave is a
cat. This is the conventionalised theologic theory, as we find it in
many examples, one of which is here shown (<a href="#v2fig21">Fig.
21</a>), as copied from a stone panel at the entrance of Lyons
Cathedral. This is what Helen&rsquo;s visions end in. She and her
younger sister of seven years, and a young neighbour, a girl of twelve,
who have become infected with Helen&rsquo;s hysterics, identify six
poor women as witches, and Edward Fairfax would have secured their
execution had it not been for the clergyman Smithson.</p>

</div>
<p>Cats played a large part in this as in other witch-trials. They had
long been regarded as an insurance of humble households. In many
regions still may be found beliefs that a three-coloured cat protects
against fire; a black cat cures epilepsy, protects gardens; and in
Bohemia a cat <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb313" href="#v2pb313"
name="v2pb313">313</a>]</span>is the favourite bridal gift to procure a
happy wedded life. One who kills a cat has no luck for seven years. The
Yorkshire women called witches remembered these proverbs to their cost.
Among the cats regarded by the Fairfaxes as familiars of the accused,
some names are notable. One is called &lsquo;Gibbe.&rsquo; This is the
Icelandic <i>gabba</i>, to &lsquo;delude,&rsquo; and our gibber; it is
the &lsquo;Gib&rsquo; cat of Reinicke Fuchs, and of the &lsquo;Romaunt
of the Rose.&rsquo; In &lsquo;Gammer Gurton&rsquo; we read, &lsquo;Hath
no man gelded Gyb, her cat;&rsquo; and in Henry IV. i. 2, &lsquo;I am
as melancholy as a gib cat.&rsquo; Another of the cats is called
<i>Inges</i>. That is, <i>ignis</i>, fire&mdash;Agni maintaining his
reign of terror.</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s devil hates the dissenter, and says, &lsquo;Cook is a
lying villain,&rsquo; because Cook exorcises him with a psalm. On the
other hand, the devil praises the clergyman, but Helen breaks out with
&lsquo;He is not worthy to be a vicar who will bear with
witches.&rsquo; Amid the religious controversies then exciting all
households, mourning for his dead child, humiliated by the suspicions
of his best neighbours that his daughter was guilty of deception,
Edward Fairfax, Gentleman, a scholar and author, lent an ear to the
vulgar superstitions of his neighbourhood. Could he have stood on the
shoulders of Grimm, he would have left us a very different narrative
than that preserved by the Philobiblion Society.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>It is hardly possible to determine now the value of the alleged
confessions of witches. They were extorted by torture or by promises of
clemency (the latter rarely fulfilled); they were shaped by
cross-examiners rather than by their victims; and their worth is still
more impaired where, as is usual, they are not given in detail, but
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb314" href="#v2pb314" name=
"v2pb314">314</a>]</span>recorded in &lsquo;substance,&rsquo; the
phraseology in such case reflecting the priest&rsquo;s preconceived
theory of witches and their orgies. It is to be feared, for instance,
that &lsquo;devil&rsquo; is often written instead of some name that
might now be interesting. Nevertheless, there seems to be ground for
believing that in many cases there were seances held to invoke
supernatural powers.</p>
<p>Among the vast number of trials and confessions, I have found none
more significant than the following. In February 1691 a daughter and
niece of Mr. Parris, minister in Salem (Massachusetts), girls of ten or
eleven years, and several other girls, complained of various bodily
torments, and as the physicians could find no cause for them, they were
pronounced bewitched. The Rev. Mr. Parris had once been in business at
the Barbadoes, and probably brought thence his two slaves, Spanish
Indians, man and wife. When the children were declared bewitched, the
Indian woman, Tituba, tried an experiment, probably with fetishes
familiar in the Barbadoes, to find out the witch. Whereupon the
children cried out against the Indian woman as appearing to them and
tormenting them. Tituba said her mistress, in her own country, had
taught her how to find out a witch, but denied being one herself; but
afterwards (urged, as she subsequently declared, by her master) she
confessed; and the marks of Spanish cruelty on her body were assumed to
be the Devil&rsquo;s wounds. The Rev. Mr. Parris in a calmer time might
have vindicated poor Tituba by taking for text of his sermon on the
subject Christ&rsquo;s saying about a house divided against itself, and
reminding the colony, which held public fast against Satan, that the
devil was too clever to cover his Salem agent with wounds; but instead
of that he preached on the words, &lsquo;Have I not chosen you twelve,
and one of you is a devil.&rsquo; During <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb315" href="#v2pb315" name="v2pb315">315</a>]</span>this sermon a
woman left the church; she was sister of a woman who had also been
accused by the children, and, being offended by something Mr. Parris
said, went out of meeting; of course, also to prison. There were three
other women involved with Tituba, in whose fetish experiments a
well-informed writer thinks the Salem delusion began.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e13202src" href="#xd20e13202" name="xd20e13202src">19</a> The
examination before the Deputy-Governor (Danforth) began at Salem, April
11, 1692, and there are several notable points in it. Tituba&rsquo;s
husband, the Indian John, cunningly escaped by pretending to be one of
the afflicted. He charged Goody Proctor, and said, &lsquo;She brought
the book to me.&rsquo; No one asked what book! Abigail Williams, also
one of the accusers of Goody, was asked, &lsquo;Does she bring the book
to you? <i>A.</i> Yes. <i>Q.</i> What would she have you do with it?
<i>A.</i> To write in it, and I shall be well.&rsquo; Not a descriptive
word is demanded or given concerning this book. The examiners are
evidently well acquainted with it. In the alleged confessions preserved
in official reports, but not in the words of the accused, the nature of
the book is made clear. Thus Mary Osgood &lsquo;confesses that about
eleven years ago, when she was in a melancholy state and condition, she
used to walk abroad in her orchard, and, upon a certain time she saw
the appearance of a cat at the end of the house, which yet she thought
was a real cat. However, at that time it diverted her from praying to
God, and instead thereof she prayed to the Devil; about which time she
made a covenant with the Devil, who, as a black man, came to her, and
presented her a book, upon which she laid her finger, and that left a
red spot. And that upon her signing that book, the devil told her that
he was her god.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb316" href=
"#v2pb316" name="v2pb316">316</a>]</span>This is not unlikely to be a
paraphrase of some sermon on the infernal Book of Satan corresponding
to the Book of Life, the theory being too conventional for the court to
inquire about the mysterious volume. Equally well known was the
Antichrist theory which had long represented that avatar of Satan as
having organised a church. Thus we read:&mdash;&lsquo;Abigail Williams,
did you see a company at Mr. Parris&rsquo;s house eat and drink?
<i>A.</i> Yes, sir; that was their sacrament. <i>Q.</i> What was it?
<i>A.</i> They said it was our blood.&rsquo; &lsquo;Mary Walcot, have
you seen a white man? <i>A.</i> Yes, sir, a great many times. <i>Q.</i>
What sort of man was he? <i>A.</i> A fine grave man, and when he came
he made all the witches to tremble.&rsquo; When it is remembered that
Mary Osgood had described the Devil as &lsquo;a black man&rsquo; (all
were thinking of the Indians), this Antiblackman suggests Christ
resisting Antichrist. Again, although nothing seems to have been said
in the court previously about baptism, one of the examiners asks
&lsquo;Goody Laccy how many years ago since they were baptized?
<i>A.</i> Three or four years ago I suppose. <i>Q.</i> Who baptized
them? <i>A.</i> The old serpent. <i>Q.</i> How did he do it? <i>A.</i>
He dipped their heads in the water, saying they were his, and that he
had power over them; ... there were six (who) baptized. <i>Q.</i> Name
them. <i>A.</i> I think they were of the higher powers<span class=
"corr" id="xd20e13261" title="Not in source">.</span>&rsquo;</p>
<p>There are interspersed through the proceedings suggestions of mercy
on condition of confession, which, joined to these theoretical
questions, render it plain that the retractations which the so-called
witches made were true, and that in New England, at least, there was
little if any basis for the delusion beyond the experiment of the two
Spanish Indians. The terrible massacre of witches which occurred there
was the result of the decision of English judges and divines that
witchcraft <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb317" href="#v2pb317" name=
"v2pb317">317</a>]</span>is recognised in the Bible, and there assigned
the death-penalty.</p>
<p>It will be observed here that ancient mythology to Salem is chiefly
that of the Bible, modified by local conditions. White man and black
man represent Christ and Antichrist, and we have the same symbols on
both sides,&mdash;eucharists, baptisms, and names written in books. The
survivals from European folklore met with in the New England trials
are&mdash;the cat, the horse (rarely), and the dog. In one case a dog
suffered from the repute of being a witch, insomuch that some who met
him fell into fits; he was put to death. Riding through the air
continues, but the American witches ride upon a stick or pole. The
old-fashioned broom, the cloud-symbol of the Wild Huntsman, is rarely
mentioned. One thing, however, survives from England, at least; the
same sharp controversy that is reflected in the Fairfax case. Cotton
Mather tried one of the possessed with the Bible, the
&lsquo;Assembly&rsquo;s Catechism,&rsquo; his grandfather&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Milk for Babes,&rsquo; his father&rsquo;s &lsquo;Remarkable
Providence,&rsquo; and a book to prove there were witches. &lsquo;And
when any of those were offered for her to read in, she would be struck
dead and fall into convulsions.&rsquo; But when he tried her with
Popish and Quaker books, the English Prayer-Book, and a book to prove
there were no witches, the devil permitted her to read these as long as
she pleased. One is at a loss which most to admire, the astuteness of
the accused witch in bearing testimony to the Puritan religion, or the
phenomenon of its eminent representative seeking a witness to it in the
Father of lies.</p>
<p>If now we travel towards the East we find the survivals growing
clearer, as in the West they become faint.</p>
<p>In 1669 the people of the villages of Mohra and Elfdale in Sweden,
believing that they were troubled by witches, were visited by a royal
commission, the result of whose <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb318"
href="#v2pb318" name="v2pb318">318</a>]</span>investigations was the
execution of twenty-three adults and fifteen children; running of the
gauntlet by thirty-six between the ages of nine and sixteen years; the
lashing on the hand of twenty children for three Sundays at the
church-door, and <span class="corr" id="xd20e13276" title=
"Source: similiar">similar</span> lashing of the aforesaid thirty-six
once a week for a year. Portions of the confessions of the witches are
given below from the Public Register as translated by Anthony Horneck,
D.D., and printed in London, anno 1700. I add a few words in brackets
to point out survivals.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We of the province of Elfdale do confess that we used to go
to a gravel-pit which lay hard by a cross-way (Hecate), and there we
put on a vest (Wolf-girdle) over our heads, and then danced round, and
after this ran to the cross-way, and called the Devil thrice, first
with a still voice, the second time somewhat louder, and the third time
very loud, with these words&mdash;<i>Antecessor</i>, <i>come and carry
us to Blockula</i>. Whereupon immediately he used to appear, but in
different habits; but for the most part we saw him in a grey coat and
red and blue stockings: he had a red beard (Barbarossa), a high-crowned
hat (Turn-cap), with linen of divers colours wrapt about it, and long
garters upon his stockings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then he asked us whether we would serve him with soul and
body. If we were content to do so, he set us upon a beast which he had
there ready, and carried us over churches and high walls; and after all
we came to a green meadow where Blockula lies. We must procure some
scrapings of altars, and filings of church clocks; and then he gives us
a horn with a salve in it, wherewith we do anoint ourselves (chrism);
and a saddle with a hammer (Thor&rsquo;s), and a wooden nail, thereby
to fix the saddle (Walkyr&rsquo;s); whereupon we call upon the Devil
and away we go.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb319" href=
"#v2pb319" name="v2pb319">319</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;For their journey, they said they made use of all sorts of
instruments, of beasts, of men, of spits, and posts, according as they
had opportunity: if they do ride upon goats (Azazel) and have many
children with them, that all may have room, they stick a spit into the
backside of the Goat, and then are anointed with the aforesaid
ointment. What the manner of their journey is, God only knows. Thus
much was made out, that if the children did at any time name the names
(Egyptian spells) of those that had carried them away, they were again
carried by force either to Blockula, or to the cross-way, and there
miserably beaten, insomuch that some of them died of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A little girl of Elfdale confessed that, naming the name of
<span class="sc">Jesus</span> as she was carried away, she fell
suddenly upon the ground, and got a great hole in her side, which the
Devil presently healed up again, and away he carried her; and to this
day the girl confessed she had exceeding great pain in her
side.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They unanimously confessed that Blockula is situated in a
delicate large meadow, whereof you can see no end. The place or house
they met at had before it a gate painted with divers colours; through
this gate they went into a little meadow distinct from the other, where
the beasts went that they used to ride on; but the men whom they made
use of in their journey stood in the house by the gate in a slumbering
posture, sleeping against the wall (castle of Waldemar). In a huge
large room of this house, they said, there stood a very long table, at
which the witches did sit down; and that hard by this room was another
chamber where there were very lovely and delicate beds. The first thing
they must do at Blockula was, that they must deny all, and devote
themselves body and soul to the Devil, and promise to serve him
faithfully, and confirm all this with an oath (initiation). Hereupon
they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb320" href="#v2pb320" name=
"v2pb320">320</a>]</span>cut their fingers (Odinism), and with their
blood write their name in his book (Revelations). They added that he
caused them to be baptized, too, by such priests as he had there
(Antichrist&rsquo;s Sacraments).&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he, the Devil, bids them believe that the day of judgment
will come speedily, and therefore sets them on work to build a great
house of stone (Babel), promising that in that house he will preserve
them from God&rsquo;s fury, and cause them to enjoy the greatest
delights and pleasures (Moslem). But while they work exceeding hard at
it, there falls a great part of the wall down again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They said, they had seen sometimes a very great Devil like a
Dragon, with fire round about him, and bound with an iron chain
(Apocalyptic), and the Devil that converses with them tells them that
if they confess anything he will let that great Devil loose upon them,
whereby all Sweedeland shall come into great danger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They added that the Devil had a church there, such another as
in the town of Mohra. When the Commissioners were coming he told the
Witches they should not fear them; for he would certainly kill them
all. And they confessed that some of them had attempted to murther the
Commissioners, but had not been able to effect it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some of the children talked much of a white Angel (Frigga as
christian tutelary), which used to forbid them what the Devil had bid
them do, and told them that those doings should not last long. What had
been done had been permitted because of the wickedness of the
people.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Those of Elfdale confessed that the Devil used to play upon
an harp before them (Tannhauser), and afterwards to go with them that
he liked best into a chamber, when he committed venerous acts with them
(Asmodeus); and this indeed all confessed, that he had carnal knowledge
of them, and that the Devil had sons and daughters <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb321" href="#v2pb321" name=
"v2pb321">321</a>]</span>by them, which he did marry together, and they
... brought forth toads and serpents (Echidna).</p>
<p>&lsquo;After this they sat down to table, and those that the Devil
esteemed most were placed nearest to him; but the children must stand
at the door, where he himself gives them meat and drink (Sacrament).
After meals they went to dancing, and in the meanwhile swore and cursed
most dreadfully, and afterwards went to fighting one with another
(Valhalla).</p>
<p>&lsquo;They also confessed that the Devil gives them a beast about
the bigness and shape of a young cat (Hecate), which they call a
carrier; and that he gives them a bird as big as a raven (Odin&rsquo;s
messenger), but white;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e13318src" href=
"#xd20e13318" name="xd20e13318src">20</a> and these two creatures they
can send anywhere, and wherever they come they take away all sorts of
victuals they can get, butter, cheese, milk, bacon, and all sorts of
seeds, whatever they find, and carry it to the witch. What the bird
brings they may keep for themselves, but what the carrier brings they
must reserve for the Devil, and that is brought to Blockula, where he
doth give them of it so much as he thinks fit. They added likewise that
these carriers fill themselves so full sometimes, that they are forced
to spue (&lsquo;Odin&rsquo;s booty&rsquo;) by the way, which spuing is
found in several gardens, where colworts grow, and not far from the
houses of these witches. It is of a yellow colour like gold, and is
called butter of witches.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Lords Commissioners were indeed very earnest, and took
great pains to persuade them to show some of their tricks, but to no
purpose; for they did all unanimously confess that since they had
confessed all, they found that all their witchcraft was gone, and that
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb322" href="#v2pb322" name=
"v2pb322">322</a>]</span>Devil at this time appeared to them very
terrible, with claws on his hands and feet, and with horns on his head,
a long tail behind, and showed to them a pit burning, with a hand put
out; but the Devil did thrust the person down again with an iron fork;
and suggested to the witches that if they continued in their
confession, he would deal with them in the same manner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The ministers of both Elfdale and Mohra were the chief inciters of
this investigation, and both testified that they had suffered many
tortures in the night from the witches. One was taken by the throat and
so violently used that &lsquo;for some weeks he was not able to speak
or perform divine service.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We have in this narrative the official and clerical statement, and
can never know to what the victims really confessed. Blockula seems to
be a Swedish edition of Blocksberg, of old considered a great resort of
witches. But we may especially note the epithet by which the witches
are said to have first appealed to the Devil&mdash;<i>Antecessor</i>.
Dr. Horneck has not given us the Swedish term of which this is a
translation, but we may feel assured that it was not a phrase coined by
the class among whom reputed witches were found. In all probability it
was a learned phrase of the time for some supposed power which preceded
and was conquered by Christianity; and if we knew its significance it
might supply a clue to the reality with which the Commissioners were
dealing. There would seem to be strong probabilities that in Sweden
also, as elsewhere, there had been a revival of faith in the old
religion whose barbaric rites had still survived in a few holes and
corners where they were practised by night. The Antecessor was still
present to hold out promises where the Successor had broken all that
his sponsors had made when the populace accepted his baptism. This
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb323" href="#v2pb323" name=
"v2pb323">323</a>]</span>probability is further suggested by the fact
that some of these uncanny events happened at Elfdale, a name which
hints at a region of especial sanctity under the old religion, and also
by the statement that the Devil had a church there, a sort of travesty
of the village church. About the same time we find John Fiene
confessing in Scotland that the Devil appeared to him in &lsquo;white
raiment,&rsquo; and it is also testified that John heard &lsquo;the
Devil preach in a kirk in the pulpit in the night by candlelight, the
candle burning blue.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e13334src" href=
"#xd20e13334" name="xd20e13334src">21</a></p>
<p>The names used by the Scotch witches are often suggestive of pagan
survivals. Thus in the trial at the Paisley Assizes, 1678, concerning
the alleged bewitching of Sir George Maxwell, <span class="corr" id=
"xd20e13340" title="Source: Magaret">Margaret</span> Jackson testified
to giving up her soul by renouncing her baptism to a devil named Locas
(Loki?); another raised a tempest to impede the king&rsquo;s voyage to
Denmark by casting into the sea a cat, and crying Hola (Hela?); and
Agnes Sampson called the Devil to her in the shape of a dog by saying,
&lsquo;Elva (Elf?), come and speak to me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is necessary to pass by many of the indications contained in the
witch-trials that there had been an effort to recur to the pleasures
and powers traditionally associated with the pagan era of Europe, and
confirmed by the very denunciations of contemporary paganism with its
pomp and luxury by the priesthood. The promises held out by the
&lsquo;Devil&rsquo; to Elfdale peasants and puritanised Helen Fairfax
are unmistakable. But it is necessary to remark also that the
ceremonies by which, as was clearly proved in various cases, the
fortune-tellers or &lsquo;witches&rsquo; endeavoured to imitate the
spells of Dr. Faustus were arch&aelig;ological.</p>
<p>Around the cauldron, which was used in imitation of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb324" href="#v2pb324" name=
"v2pb324">324</a>]</span>the Alchemists, a rude Zodiac was marked, some
alchemic signs being added; and in the cauldron were placed ingredients
concerning many of which the accounts are confused. It is, however,
certain that the chief ingredients were plants which, precisely as in
ancient Egypt, had been gathered at certain phases of the moon, or
seasons of the year, or from some spot where the sun was supposed not
to have shone on it. It was clearly proved also that the plants chiefly
used by the sorceresses were rue and vervain. Vervain was sacred to the
god of war in Greece and Rome, and made the badge of ambassadors sent
to make treaties of peace. In Germany it was sacred to Thor, and he
would not strike with his lightning a house protected by it. The Druids
called it &lsquo;holy herb;&rsquo; they gathered it when the dog-star
rose, from unsunned spots, and compensated the earth for the
deprivation with a sacrifice of honey. Its reputation was sufficient in
Ben Jonson&rsquo;s day for him to write&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Bring your garlands, and with reverence place</p>
<p class="line">The vervain on the altar.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The charm which vervain had for the medi&aelig;val
peasant was that it was believed, if it had first touched a Bel-fire,
to snap iron; and, if boiled with rue, made a liquid which, being
poured on a gunflint, made the shot as sure to take effect as any
<span lang="de">Freisch&uuml;tz</span> could desire.</p>
<p>Rue was supposed to have a potent effect on the eye, and to bestow
second sight. So sacred was it once in England that missionaries
sprinkled holy water from brushes made up of it, whence it was called
&lsquo;herb of grace.&rsquo; Milton represents Michael as purging
Adam&rsquo;s eyes with it. In the Tyrol it is believed to confer fine
vision and used with agrimony (flowers of Argos, the many-eyed); in
Posen it is said also to heal serpent-bites. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb325" href="#v2pb325" name=
"v2pb325">325</a>]</span>By this route it came into the cauldron of the
wizard and witch. In Drayton&rsquo;s incantation it is said&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Then sprinkles she the juice of rue,</p>
<p class="line">With nine drops of the midnight dew</p>
<p class="line">From lunary distilling.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This association of lunary, or moon-wort, once
supposed to cure lunacy, with rue is in harmony with the mythology of
both. An old oracle, said to have been revealed by Hecate herself, ran
thus:&mdash;&lsquo;From a root of wild rue fashion and polish a statue;
adorn it with household lizards; grind myrrh, gum, and frankincense
with the same reptiles, and let the mixture stand in the air during the
waning of a moon; then address your vows in the following terms&rsquo;
(the formula is not preserved). &lsquo;As many forms as I have, so many
lizards let there be; do these things exactly; you will build me an
abode with branches of laurel, and having addressed fervent prayers to
the image, you will see me in your sleep.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e13372src" href="#xd20e13372" name="xd20e13372src">22</a></p>
<p>Rue was thus consecrated as the very substance of Hecate, the mother
of all European witches. M. Maury supposes that it was because it was a
narcotic and caused hallucinations. Hallucinations were, no doubt, the
basis of belief in second sight. But whatever may be the cause, rue was
the plant of witchcraft; and Bishop Taylor speaks of its being used by
exorcists to try the devil, and thence deriving its appellation
&lsquo;herb of grace.&rsquo; More probably it was used to sprinkle holy
water because of a traditional <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb326"
href="#v2pb326" name="v2pb326">326</a>]</span>sanctity. All narcotics
were supposed to be children of the night; and if, in addition, they
were able to cause hallucinations, they were supposed to be under more
especial care of the moon.</p>
<p>After reading a large number of reports concerning the ordeals and
trials of witches, and also many of their alleged confessions, I have
arrived at the conclusion that there were certainly gatherings held in
secret places; that some of the ordinary ceremonies and prayers of the
Church were used, with names of traditional deities and Oriental demons
substituted for those of the Trinity and saints; that with these were
mingled some observances which had been preserved from the ancient
world by Gnostics, Astrologists, and Alchemists. That at these
gatherings there was sometimes direct devil-worship is probable, but
oftener the invocations were in other names, and it is for the most
part due to the legal reporters that the &lsquo;Devil&rsquo; is so
often named. As to the &lsquo;confessions,&rsquo; many, no doubt,
admitted they had gone to witches&rsquo; Sabbaths who had been there
only in feverish dreams, as must have been the case of many young
children and morbid pietists who were executed; others confessed in
hope of escape from charges they could not answer; and others were
weary of their lives.</p>
<p>The writer of this well remembers, in a small Virginian village
(Falmouth), more than thirty years ago, the terrible persecutions to
which an old white woman named Nancy Calamese was subjected because of
her reputation as a witch. Rumours of lizards vomited by her poor
neighbours caused her to be dreaded by the ignorant; the negroes were
in terror of her; she hardly dared pass through the streets for fear of
being hooted by boys. One morning she waded into the Rappahannock river
and drowned herself, and many of her neighbours regarded the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb327" href="#v2pb327" name=
"v2pb327">327</a>]</span>suicide as her confession. Probably it was a
similar sort of confession to many that we read in the reports of witch
trials.</p>
<p>The retribution that followed was more ferocious than could have
visited mere attempts by the poor and ignorant to call up spirits to
their aid. Every now and then the prosecutions disclose the well-known
animus of heresy, persecution, and also the fury of magistrates
suspicious of conspiracies. In England, New England, and France,
particularly, an incipient rationalism was revealed in the party called
&lsquo;Saducees,&rsquo; who tried to cast discredit on the belief in
witchcraft. This was recognised by Sir Mathew Hale in England and
Cotton Mather in New England, consequently by the chief authorities of
church and state in both countries, as an attack on biblical
infallibility, since it was said in the Bible, &lsquo;Thou shalt not
suffer a witch to live.&rsquo; The leading wizards and witches were
probably also persons who had been known in connection with the popular
discontent and revolutionary feeling displayed in so many of the
vindictive conjurations which were brought to light.</p>
<p>The horrors which attended the crushing out of this last revival of
paganism are such as recall the Bartholomew massacre and the recent
slaughter of Communists in Paris, so vividly that one can hardly
repress the suspicion that the same sort of mingled panic and
fanaticism were represented in them all. Dr. R&eacute;ville has summed
up the fearful history of three hundred years as
follows:&mdash;&lsquo;In the single year 1485, and in the district of
Worms alone, eighty-five witches were delivered to the flames. At
Geneva, at Basle, at Hamburg, at Ratisbon, at Vienna, and in a
multitude of other towns, there were executions of the same kind. At
Hamburg, among other victims, a physician was burnt alive, because he
saved the life of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb328" href=
"#v2pb328" name="v2pb328">328</a>]</span>woman who had been given up by
the midwife. In Italy, during the year 1523, there were burnt in the
diocese of Como alone more than two hundred witches. This was after the
new bull hurled at witchcraft by Pope Adrian VI. In Spain it was still
worse; there, in 1527, two little girls, of from nine to eleven years
of age, denounced a host of witches, whom they pretended to detect by a
mark in their left eye. In England and Scotland political influence was
brought to bear upon sorcery; Mary Stuart was animated by a lively zeal
against witches. In France the Parliament of Paris happily removed
business of this kind from the ecclesiastical tribunals; and under
Louis XI., Charles VIII., and Louis XII. there were but few
condemnations for the practice of magic; but from the time of Francis
I., and especially from Henry II., the scourge reappeared. Jean Bodin,
a man of sterling worth in other respects, but stark mad upon the
question of witchcraft, communicated his mania to all classes of the
nation. His contemporary and disciple, Boguet, showed how that France
swarmed with witches and wizards. &lsquo;They increase and multiply on
the land,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;even as do the caterpillars in our
gardens. Would that they were all got together in a heap, so that a
single fire might burn them all at once.&rsquo; Savoy, Flanders, the
Jura Mountains, Lorraine, B&eacute;arn, Provence, and in almost all
parts of France, the frightful hecatombs were seen ablaze. In the
seventeenth century the witch-fever somewhat abated, though it burst
out here and there, centralising itself chiefly in the convents of
hysterical nuns. The terrible histories of the priests Gaufridy and
Urban Grandier are well known. In Germany, and particularly in its
southern parts, witch-burning was still more frequent. In one small
principality at least 242 persons were burnt between 1646 and 1651;
and, <i lang="la">horribile dictu</i>, in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb329" href="#v2pb329" name="v2pb329">329</a>]</span>the official
records of these executions, we find that among those who suffered were
children from one to six years of age! In 1657 the witch-judge,
Nicholas Remy, boasted of having burnt 900 persons in fifteen years. It
would even seem that it is to the proceedings against sorcery that
Germany owes the introduction of torture as an ordinary mode of getting
at the truth. Mr. Roskoff reproduces a catalogue of the executions of
witches and wizards in the episcopal town of W&uuml;rzburg, in Bavaria,
up to the year 1629. In 1659 the number of those put to death for
witchcraft amounted, in this diocese, to 900. In the neighbouring
bishopric of Bamberg at least 600 were burnt. He enumerates thirty-one
executions in all, not counting some regarded by the compilers of the
catalogue as not important enough to mention. The number of victims at
each execution varies from two to seven. Many are distinguished by such
surnames as &lsquo;The Big Hunchback, The Sweetheart, The
Bridge-keeper, The Old Pork-woman,&rsquo; &amp;c. Among them appear
people of all sorts and conditions, actors, workmen, jugglers, town and
village maidens, rich burghers, nobles, students, magistrates even, and
a fair number of priests. Many are simply entered as &lsquo;a
foreigner.&rsquo; Here and there is added to the name of the condemned
person his age and a short notice. Among the victims, for instance, of
the twentieth execution figures &lsquo;Little Barbara, the prettiest
girl in W&uuml;rzburg;&rsquo; &lsquo;a student who could speak all
manner of languages, who was an excellent musician, <i lang=
"fr">vocaliter et instrumentaliter</i>;&rsquo; &lsquo;the master of the
hospice, a very learned man.&rsquo; We find, too, in this, gloomy
account the cruel record of children burnt for witchcraft; here a
little girl of about nine or ten years of age, with her baby sister,
younger than herself (their mother was burnt a little while
afterwards); here boys of ten or eleven; again, a young <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb330" href="#v2pb330" name=
"v2pb330">330</a>]</span>girl of fifteen; two children from the
poorhouse; the little boy of a councillor. The pen falls from
one&rsquo;s hand in recapitulating such monstrosities. Cannot those who
would endow Catholicity with the dogma of papal infallibility hearken,
before giving their vote, to the cries that rise before God, and which
history re-echoes, of those poor innocent ones whom pontifical bulls
threw into flames? The seventeenth century saw the rapid diminution of
trials and tortures. In one of his good moments, Louis XIV. mitigated
greatly the severity of this special legislation. For this he had to
undergo the remonstrances of the Parliament of Rouen, which believed
society would be ruined if those who dealt in sorcery were merely
condemned to perpetual confinement. The truth is, that belief in
witchcraft was so wide-spread, that from time to time even throughout
the seventeenth century there were isolated executions. One of the
latest and most notorious was that of Renata Saenger, superior of the
convent of Unterzell, near W&uuml;rzburg (1748). At Landshut, in
Bavaria, in 1756, a young girl of thirteen years was convicted of
impure intercourse with the Devil, and put to death. Seville in 1781,
and Glaris in 1783, saw the last two known victims to this fatal
superstition.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e13403src" href=
"#xd20e13403" name="xd20e13403src">23</a></p>
<p>The Reformation swept away in Northern countries, for the upper
classes, as many Christian saints and angels as priestcraft had
previously turned to enemies for the lower. The poor and ignorant
simply tried to evoke the same ideal spirit-guardians under the pagan
forms legendarily associated with a golden age. Witchcraft was a
pathetic appeal against a cruel present to a fair, however visionary,
past. But Protestantism has brought on famine of another
kind&mdash;famine of the heart. The saints of the Church have followed
those of paganism; and although one result of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb331" href="#v2pb331" name=
"v2pb331">331</a>]</span>the process has been a vast increase in
enterprise, science, and wealth, man cannot live by these alone. Modern
spiritualism, which so many treat with a superciliousness little
creditable to a scientific age, is a cry of starved sentiment and
affections left hopeless under faded heavens, as full of pathetic
meaning as that which was wrung from serfs enticed into temples only to
find them dens of thieves. Desolate hearts take up the burthen of
desolate homes, and appeal to invisible powers for guidance; and for
attestation of hopes which science has blighted, ere poetry, art, and
philanthropy have changed these ashes into beauty. Because these
so-called spirits, evoked by mediums out of morbid nerves, are really
longed-for ideals, the darker features of witchcraft are not called
about them. That fearful movement was a wronged Medea whose sorrows had
made Hecate&mdash;to remember the dreadful phrase of
Euripides&mdash;&lsquo;the chosen assistant dwelling in the inmost
recesses of her house.&rsquo; Modern spiritualism is Rachel weeping for
her children, not to be comforted if they are not. But the madness of
the one is to be understood by the plaintive appeal of the other.

&lsquo;Mephostophiles,&rsquo; and conjectures that it was a bungling
effort to put together three Greek words, to mean &lsquo;not loving the
light.&rsquo; In this he has the support of Bayard Taylor, who also
thinks that it was so understood by Goethe. The transformation of it
was probably amid the dreaded gases with which the primitive chemist
surrounded himself. He who began by &lsquo;not loving the light&rsquo;
became the familiar of men seeking light, and lover of their mephitic
gases. The ancient Romans had a mysterious divinity called Mephitis,
whose grove and temple were in the Esquili&aelig;, near a place it was
thought fatal to enter. She is thought to have been invoked against the
mephitic exhalations of the earth in the grove of Albunea. Sulphur
springs also <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb333" href="#v2pb333"
name="v2pb333">333</a>]</span>were of old regarded as ebullitions from
hell, and both Schwarz and Roger Bacon particularly dealt in that kind
of smell. Considering how largely Asmodeus, as &lsquo;fine
gentleman,&rsquo; entered into the composition of Mephistopheles, and
how he flew from Nineveh to Egypt (Tobit) to avoid a bad smell, it
seems the irony of mythology that he should turn up in Europe as a
mephitic spirit.</p>
<p>Mephistopheles is the embodiment of all that has been said in
preceding chapters of the ascetic&rsquo;s horror of nature and the
pride of life, and of the medi&aelig;val priest&rsquo;s curse on all
learning he could not monopolise. The Faust myth is merely his shadow
cast on the earth, the tracery of his terrible power as the Church
would have the people dread it. The early Raven Book at Dresden has the
title:&mdash;&lsquo; <span lang="de">&dagger; &dagger; &dagger; D. J.

<p>This is an impudent forgery, but it is an invention which, more than
anything actually issued from Rome, indicates the popular understanding
that the contention of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb334" href=
"#v2pb334" name="v2pb334">334</a>]</span>the Church was not against the
validity of magic arts, but against their exercise by persons not
authorised by itself. It was, indeed, a tradition not combated by the
priests, that various ecclesiastics had possessed such powers, even
Popes, as John XXII., Gregory VII., and Clement V. The first Sylvester
was said to have a dragon at his command; John XXII. denounced his
physicians and courtiers for necromancy; and the whispers connecting
the Vatican with sorcery lasted long enough to attribute to the late
Pius IX. a power of the evil eye. Such awful potencies the Church
wished to be ascribed to itself alone. Faust is a legend invented to
impress on the popular mind the fate of all who sought knowledge in
unauthorised ways and for non-ecclesiastical ends.</p>
<p>In the Raven Book just mentioned, there are provisions for calling
up spirits which, in their blending of christian with pagan formulas,
oddly resemble the solemn proceedings sometimes affected by our
spiritual mediums. The magician (<i>Magister</i>) had best be alone,
but if others are present, their number must be odd; he should
deliberate beforehand what business he wishes to transact with the
spirits; he must observe God&rsquo;s commandment; trust the
Almighty&rsquo;s help; continue his conjuration, though the spirits do
not appear quickly, with unwavering faith; mark a circle on parchment
with a dove&rsquo;s blood; within this circle write in Latin the names
of the four quarters of heaven; write around it the Hebrew letters of
God&rsquo;s name, and beneath it write <i>Sadan</i>; and standing in
this circle he must repeat the ninety-first Psalm. In addition there
are seals in red and black, various Hebrew, Greek, and Latin words,
chiefly such as contain the letters Q, W, X, Y, Z,&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>,
Yschyros, Theos, Zebaoth, Adonay. The specimen (<a href="#v2fig22">Fig.
22</a>), which I copied from the book in Dresden, is there called
&lsquo;Sigillum Telschunhab.&rsquo; The &lsquo;Black Raven&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb335" href="#v2pb335" name=
"v2pb335">335</a>]</span>is pictured in the book, and explained as the
form in which the angel Raphael taught Tobias to summon spirits. It is
said also that the Magician must in certain cases write with blood of a
fish (Tobit again) or bat on &lsquo;maiden-parchment,&rsquo;&mdash;this
being explained as the skin of a goat, but unpleasantly suggestive of a
different origin.</p>

</div>
<p>In this book, poorly printed, and apparently on a private press,
Mephistopheles is mentioned as one of the chief Princes of Hell. He is
described as a youth, adept in all arts and services, who brings
spirit-servants or familiars, and brings treasures from earth and sea
with speed. In the Frankfort Faust Book (1587), Mephistopheles says,
&lsquo;I am a spirit, and a flying spirit, potently ruling under the
heavens.&rsquo; In the oldest legends he appears as a dog, that, as we
have seen, being the normal form of tutelary divinities, the symbol of
the Scribe in Egypt, guard of Hades, and psychopomp of various
mythologies. A dog appears following the family of Tobias. Manlius
reports Melancthon as saying, &lsquo;He (Faust) had a dog with him,
which was the Devil.&rsquo; Johann Gast (&lsquo;<span lang=
"la">Sermones Conviviales</span>&rsquo;) says he was present at a
dinner at Basle given by Faust, and adds: &lsquo;He had also a dog and
a horse with him, both of which, I believe, were devils, for they were
able to do everything. Some persons told me that the dog frequently
took the shape of a servant, and brought him food.&rsquo; In the old
legends this dog is named <i>Praestigiar</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e13489src" href="#xd20e13489" name="xd20e13489src">2</a></p>
<p>As for the man Faust, he seems to have been personally the very
figure which the Church required, and had the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb336" href="#v2pb336" name=
"v2pb336">336</a>]</span>friar, in whose guise Mephistopheles appears,
been his actual familiar, he could hardly have done more to bring
learning into disgrace. Born at the latter part of the fifteenth
century at Knittlingen, Wurtemberg, of poor parents, the bequest of an
uncle enabled him to study medicine at Cracow University, and it seems
plain that he devoted his learning and abilities to the work of
deluding the public. That he made money by his
&lsquo;mediumship,&rsquo; one can only infer from the activity with
which he went about Germany and advertised his &lsquo;powers.&rsquo; It
was at a time when high prices were paid for charms, philtres, mandrake
mannikins; and the witchcraft excitement was not yet advanced enough to
render dealing in such things perilous. It seems that the Catholic
clergy made haste to use this impostor to point their moral against
learning, and to identify him as first-fruit of the Reformation; while
the Reformers, with equal zeal, hurled him back upon the papists as
outcome of their idolatries. Melancthon calls him &lsquo;an abominable
beast, a sewer of many devils.&rsquo; The first mention of him is by
Trithemius in a letter of August 20, 1507, who speaks of him as
&lsquo;a pretender to magic&rsquo; (&lsquo;Magister Georgius
Sabellicus, Faustus Junior&rsquo;), whom he met at Gelnhaussen; and in
another letter of the same year as at Kreuznach, Conrad Mudt, friend of
Luther and Melancthon, mentions (Oct. 3, 1513) the visit to Erfurth of
Georgius Faustus Hemitheus Hedebeyensis, &lsquo;a braggart and a fool
who affects magic,&rsquo; whom he had &lsquo;heard talking in a
tavern,&rsquo; and who had &lsquo;raised theologians against
him.&rsquo; In Vogel&rsquo;s Annals of Leipzig (1714), kept in
Auerbach&rsquo;s Cellar, is recorded under date 1525 Dr. Johann
Faust&rsquo;s visit to the Cellar. He appears therefore to have already
had <i>aliases</i>. The first clear account of him is in the
&lsquo;<span lang="la">Index Sanitatis</span>&rsquo; of Dr. Philip
Begardi (1539), who says: &lsquo;Since several years he has gone
through all regions, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb337" href=
"#v2pb337" name="v2pb337">337</a>]</span>provinces, and kingdoms, made
his name known to everybody, and is highly renowned for his great
skill, not alone in medicine, but also in chiromancy, necromancy,
physiognomy, visions in crystal, and the like other arts. And also not
only renowned, but written down and known as an experienced master.
Himself admitted, nor denied that it was so, and that his name was
Faustus, and called himself <i lang="la">philosophum philosophorum</i>.
But how many have complained to me that they were deceived by
him&mdash;verily a great number! But what matter?&mdash;<i lang=
"de">hin ist hin</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These latter words may mean that Faust had just died. He must have
died about that time, and with little notice. The rapidity with which a
mythology began to grow around him is worthy of more attention than the
subject has received. In 1543 the protestant theologian Johann Gast has
(&lsquo;<span lang="la">Sermones Convivialium</span>&rsquo;) stories of
his diabolical dog and horse, and of the Devil&rsquo;s taking him off,
when his body turns itself five times face downward. In 1587 Philip
Camerarius speaks of him as &lsquo;a well-known <span class="corr" id=
"xd20e13516" title="Source: magican">magician</span> who lived in the
time of our fathers.&rsquo; April 18, 1587, two students of the
University of T&uuml;bingen were imprisoned for writing a Comedy of Dr.
Faustus: though it was not permitted to make light of the story, it was
thought a very proper one to utilise for pious purposes, and in the
autumn of the same year (1587) the original form of the legend was
published by Spiess in Frankfort. It describes Faust as summoning the
Devil at night, in a forest near Wittenberg. The evil spirit visits him
on three occasions in his study, where on the third he gives his name
as &lsquo;Mephostophiles,&rsquo; and the compact to serve him for
twenty-four years for his soul is signed. When Faust pierces his hand,
the blood flows into the form of the words <i>O homo fuge!</i>
Mephistopheles first serves him as a monk, and brings him fine
garments, wine, and food. Many of the luxuries are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb338" href="#v2pb338" name=
"v2pb338">338</a>]</span>brought from the mansions of prelates, which
shows the protestant bias of the book; which is also shown in the
objection the Devil makes to Faust&rsquo;s marrying, because marriage
is pleasing to God. Mephistopheles changes himself to a winged horse,
on which Faust is borne through many countries, arriving at last at
Rome. Faust passes three days, invisible, in the Vatican, which
supplies the author with another opportunity to display papal luxury,
as well as the impotence of the Pope and his cardinals to exorcise the
evil powers which take their food and goblets when they are about to
feast. On his further aerial voyages Faust gets a glimpse of the garden
of Eden; lives in state in the Sultan&rsquo;s palace in the form of
Mohammed; and at length becomes a favourite in the Court of Charles V.
at Innsbruck. Here he evokes Alexander the Great and his wife. In
roaming about Germany, Faust diverts himself by swallowing a load of
hay and horses, cutting off heads and replacing them, making flowers
bloom at Christmas, drawing wine from a table, and calling Helen of
Troy to appear to some students. Helen becomes his mistress; by her he
has a son, Justus Faustus; but these disappear simultaneously with the
dreadful end of Dr. Faustus, who after a midnight storm is found only
in the fragments with which his room is strewn.</p>
<p>Several of these legends are modifications of those current before
Faust&rsquo;s time. The book had such an immense success that new
volumes and versions on the same subject appeared not only in Germany
but in other parts of Europe,&mdash;a rhymed version in England, 1588;
a translation from the German in France, 1589; a Dutch translation,
1592; Christopher Marlowe&rsquo;s drama in 1604.</p>
<p>In Marlowe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Tragical History of Doctor Faustus,&rsquo;
the mass of legends of occult arts that had crystallised around
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb339" href="#v2pb339" name=
"v2pb339">339</a>]</span>a man thoroughly representative of them was
treated with the dignity due to a subject amid whose moral and historic
grandeur Faust is no longer the petty personality he really was. He is
precisely the character which the Church had been creating for a
thousand years, only suddenly changed from other-worldly to worldly
desires and aims. What he seeks is what all the energy of civilisation
seeks.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb340" href="#v2pb340" name=
"v2pb340">340</a>]</span>were heard the echoes of the early christian
voices which exulted in the eternal tortures of the Greek poets and
philosophers: the anathemas on Roger Bacon, Socinus, Galileo; the
outcries with which every great invention has been met. We need only
retouch the above extracts here and there to make Faust&rsquo;s
aspirations those of a saint. Let the gold be sought in New Jerusalem,
the pearl in its gates, the fruits in paradise, the philosophy that of
Athanasius, and no amount of selfish hunger and thirst for them would
grieve any &lsquo;Good Angel&rsquo; he had ever heard of.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Good Angel&rsquo; has not yet gained his wings who will
tell him that all he seeks is included in the task of humanity, but
warn him that the method by which he would gain it is just that by
which he has been instructed to seek gold and jasper of the New
<span class="corr" id="xd20e13601" title=
"Source: Jerusalen">Jerusalem</span>,&mdash;not by fulfilling the
conditions of them, but as the object of some favouritism. Every human
being who ever sought to obtain benefit by prayers or praises that
might win the good graces of a supposed bestower of benefits, instead
of by working for them, is but the Faust of his side&mdash;be it
supernal or infernal. Hocus-pocus and invocation, blood-compacts and
sacraments,&mdash;they are all the same in origin; they are all mean
attempts to obtain advantages beyond other people without serving up to
them or deserving them. To Beelzebub Faust will &lsquo;build an altar
and a church;&rsquo; but he had probably never entered a church or
knelt before an altar with any less selfishness.</p>
<p>A strong Nemesis follows Self to see that its bounds are not
overpassed without retribution. Its satisfactions must be weighed in
the balance with its renunciations. And the inflexible law applies to
intellect and self-culture as much as to any other power of man.
Mephistopheles is &lsquo;the kernel of the brute;&rsquo; he is the
intellect with mere canine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb341" href=
"#v2pb341" name="v2pb341">341</a>]</span>hunger for knowledge because
of the power it brings. Or, falling on another part of human nature, it
is pride making itself abject for ostentation; or it is passion selling
love for lust. <i>Re-enter Mephistopheles with Devils, who give crowns
and rich apparel to Faustus, dance, and then depart.</i> To the man who
has received his intellectual and moral liberty only to so spend it,
Lucifer may well say, in Marlowe&rsquo;s words&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Christ cannot save thy soul, for he is just:</p>
<p class="line">There&rsquo;s none but I have interest in the same.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Perhaps he might even better have suggested to Faust
that his soul was not of sufficient significance to warrant much
anxiety.</p>
<p>Something was gained when it was brought before the people in
popular dramas of Faust how little the Devil cared for the cross which
had so long been regarded as the all-sufficient weapon against
him.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e13621src" href="#xd20e13621" name=
"xd20e13621src">3</a> Faust and Mephistopheles flourish in the Vatican
despite all the crosses raised to exorcise them. The confession of the
cross which once meant martyrdom of the confessor had now come to mean
martyrdom of the denier. Protestantism put its faith in Theology,
Creeds, and Orthodoxy. But Calderon de la Barca blended the legend of
Faust with the legendary temptation of St. Cyprian, and in &lsquo;El
Magico Prodigioso&rsquo; we have, in impressive contrast, the
powerlessness of the evil powers over the heart of a pure woman, and
its easy entrance into a mind fully furnished with the soundest
sentiments of theology. St. Cyprian had been a worshipper of pagan
deities<a class="noteref" id="xd20e13624src" href="#xd20e13624" name=
"xd20e13624src">4</a> before his conversion, and even after this he had
once saved himself while other christians <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb342" href="#v2pb342" name="v2pb342">342</a>]</span>were suffering
martyrdom. It is possible that out of this may have grown the legend of
his having called his earlier deities&mdash;theoretically changed to
devils&mdash;to his aid; a trace of the legend being that magical
&lsquo;Book of Cyprianus&rsquo; mentioned in another chapter. In his
tract &lsquo;<span lang="la">De Gratia Dei</span>&rsquo; Cyprian says
concerning his spiritual condition before conversion, &lsquo;I lay in
darkness, and floating on the world&rsquo;s boisterous sea, with no
resting-place for my feet, ignorant of my proper life, and estranged
from truth and light.&rsquo; Here is a metaphorical &lsquo;vasty
deep&rsquo; from which the centuries could hardly fail to conjure up
spirits, one of them being the devil of Calderon&rsquo;s drama, who
from a wrecked ship walks Christ-like over the boisterous sea to find
Cyprian on the sea-shore. The drama opens with a scene which recalls
the most perilous of St. Anthony&rsquo;s temptations. According to
Athanasius, the Devil having utterly failed to conquer Anthony&rsquo;s
virtue by charming images, came to him in his proper black and ugly
shape, and, candidly confessing that he was the Devil, said he had been
vanquished by the saint&rsquo;s extraordinary sanctity. Anthony
prevailed against the spirit of pride thus awakened; but
Calderon&rsquo;s Cyprian, though he does not similarly recognise the
Devil, becomes complacent at the dialectical victory which the tempter
concedes him. Cyprian having argued the existence and supremacy of God,
the Devil says, &lsquo;How can I impugn so clear a consequence?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Do you regret my victory?&rsquo; &lsquo;Who but regrets a check
in rivalry of wit?&rsquo; He leaves, and Cyprian says, &lsquo;I never
met a more learned person.&rsquo; The Devil is equally satisfied,
knowing, no doubt, that gods worked out by the wits alone remain in
their abode of abstraction and do not interfere with the world of
sense. Calderon is artful enough to throw the trial of Cyprian back
into his pagan period, but the mirror is no less true in reflecting
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb343" href="#v2pb343" name=
"v2pb343">343</a>]</span>for those who had eyes to see in it the
weakness of theology.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Enter the Devil as a fine gentleman,&rsquo; is the first sign
of the temptation in Calderon&rsquo;s drama&mdash;it is
Asmodeus<a class="noteref" id="xd20e13636src" href="#xd20e13636" name=
"xd20e13636src">5</a> again, and the &lsquo;pride of life&rsquo; he
first brings is the conceit of a clever theological victory. So
sufficient is the doorway so made for all other pride to enter, that
next time the devil needs no disguise, but has only to offer him a
painless victory over nature and the world, including Justina, the
object of his passion.</p>

move mountains and conquer beasts, until he boasts that he can excel
his infernal teacher, but the Devil cannot bring Justina. She has told
Cyprian that she will love him in death. Cyprian and she together
abjure their paganism at Antioch, and meet in a cell just before their
martyrdom. Over their bodies lying dead on the scaffold the Devil
appears as a winged serpent, and says he is compelled to announce that
they have both ascended to heaven. He descends into the earth.</p>
<p>What the story of Faust and Mephistopheles had become in the popular
mind of Germany, when Goethe was raising it to be an immortal type of
the conditions under which genius and art can alone fulfil their task,
is well shown in the sensational tragedy written by his contemporary,
the playwright Klinger. The following extract from Klinger&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Faust&rsquo; is not without a certain impressiveness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Night covered the earth with its raven wing. Faust stood
before the awful spectacle of the body of his son suspended upon the
gallows. Madness parched his brain, and he exclaimed in the wild tones
of dispair:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Satan, let me but bury this unfortunate being, and then you
may take this life of mine, and I will descend into your infernal
abode, where I shall no more behold men in the flesh. I have learned to
know them, and I am disgusted with them, with their destiny, with the
world, and with life. My good action has drawn down unutterable woe
upon my head; I hope that my evil ones may have been productive of
good. Thus should it be in the mad confusion of earth. Take me hence; I
wish to become an inhabitant of thy dreary abode; I am tired of light,
compared with which the darkness in the infernal regions must be the
brightness of mid-day.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb345"
href="#v2pb345" name="v2pb345">345</a>]</span></p>
<p>But Satan replied: &lsquo;Hold! not so fast&mdash;Faust; once I told
thee that thou alone shouldst be the arbiter of thy life, that thou
alone shouldst have power to break the hour-glass of thy existence;
thou hast done so, and the hour of my vengeance has come, the hour for
which I have sighed so long. Here now do I tear from thee thy mighty
wizard-wand, and chain thee within the narrow bounds which I draw
around thee. Here shalt thou stand and listen to me, and tremble; I
will draw forth the terrors of the dark past, and kill thee with slow
despair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thus will I exult over thee, and rejoice in my victory. Fool!
thou hast said that thou hast learned to know man! Where? How and when?
Hast thou ever considered his nature? Hast thou ever examined it, and
separated from it its foreign elements? Hast thou distinguished between
that which is offspring of the pure impulses of his heart, and that
which flows from an imagination corrupted by art? Hast thou compared
the wants and the vices of his nature with those which he owes to
society and prevailing corruption? Hast thou observed him in his
natural state, where each of his undisguised expressions mirrors forth
his inmost soul? No&mdash;thou hast looked upon the mask that society
wears, and hast mistaken it for the true lineaments of man; thou hast
only become acquainted with men who have consecrated their condition,
wealth, power, and talents to the service of corruption; who have
sacrificed their pure nature to your Idol&mdash;Illusion. Thou didst at
one time presume to show me the moral worth of man! and how didst thou
set about it! By leading me upon the broad highways of vice, by
bringing me to the courts of the mighty wholesale butchers of men, to
that of the coward tyrant of France, of the Usurper in England! Why did
we pass by the mansions of the good and the just? Was it for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb346" href="#v2pb346" name=
"v2pb346">346</a>]</span>me, Satan, to whom thou hast chosen to become
a mentor, to point them out to thee? No; thou wert led to the places
thou didst haunt by the fame of princes, by thy pride, by thy longing
after dissipation. And what hast thou seen there? The soul-seared
tyrants of mankind, with their satellites, wicked women and mercenary
priests, who make religion a tool by which to gain the object of their
base passions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hast thou ever deigned to cast a glance at the oppressed,
who, sighing under his burden, consoles himself with the hope of an
hereafter? Hast thou ever sought for the dwelling of the virtuous
friend of humanity, for that of the noble sage, for that of the active
and upright father of a family?</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how would that have been possible? How couldst thou, the
most corrupt of thy race, have discovered the pure one, since thou
hadst not even the capacity to suspect his existence?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Proudly didst thou pass by the cottages of the pure and
humble, who live unacquainted with even the names of your artificial
vices, who earn their bread in the sweat of their brow, and who rejoice
at their last hour that they are permitted to exchange the mortal for
the immortal. It is true, hadst thou entered their abode, thou mightst
not have found thy foolish ideal of an heroic, extravagant virtue,
which is only the fanciful creation of your vices and your pride; but
thou wouldst have seen the man of a retiring modesty and noble
resignation, who in his obscurity excels in virtue and true grandeur of
soul your boasted heroes of field and cabinet. Thou sayest that thou
knowest man! Dost thou know thyself? Nay, deeper yet will I enter into
the secret places of thy heart, and fan with fierce blast the flames
which thou hast kindled there for thee. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>&lsquo;Had I a thousand human tongues, and as many years to speak to
thee, they would be all insufficient to develop the consequences of thy
deeds and thy recklessness. The germ of wretchedness which thou hast
sown will continue its growth through centuries yet to come; and future
generations will curse thee as the author of their misery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Behold, then, daring and reckless man, the importance of
actions that appear circumscribed to your mole vision! Who of you can
say, Time will obliterate the trace of my existence! Thou who knowest
not what beginning, what middle, and end are, hast dared to seize with
a bold hand the chain of fate, and hast attempted to gnaw its links,
notwithstanding that they were forged for eternity!</p>
<p>&lsquo;But now will I withdraw the veil from before thy eyes, and
then&mdash;cast the spectre despair into thy soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Faust pressed his hands upon his face; the worm that never
dieth gnawed already on his heart.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He knows, too, that the existing moment alone is of any advantage;
that theory is grey and life ever green; that he only gathers real
fruit who confides in himself. He is thus the perfectly evolved
intellect of man, fully in possession of all its implements, these
polished till they shine in all grace, subtlety, adequacy. Nature shows
no symbol of such power more complete than the gemmed serpent with its
exquisite adaptations,&mdash;freed from cumbersome prosaic feet, equal
to the winged by its flexible spine, every tooth artistic.</p>
<p>From an ancient prison was this Ariel liberated by his Prospero,
whose wand was the Reformation, a spirit finely touched to fine issues.
But his wings cannot fly beyond the atmosphere. The ancient heaven has
faded before the clearer eye, but the starry ideals have come nearer.
The old hells have burnt out, but the animalism of man couches all the
more freely on his path, having broken every chain of fear. Man still
walks between the good and evil, on the hair-drawn bridge of his moral
nature. His faculties seem adapted with equal precision to either side
of his life, upper or under,&mdash;to Wisdom or Cunning, Self-respect
or Self-conceit, Prudence or Selfishness, Lust or Love.</p>
<p>Such is the seeming situation, but is it the reality? Goethe&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Faust&rsquo; is the one clear answer which this question has
received.</p>
<p>In one sense Mephistopheles may be called a German devil. The
Christian soul of Germany was from the first a changeling. The ancient
Nature-worship of that race might have had its normal development in
the sciences, and alone with this intellectual evolution there must
have been formed a related religion able to preserve social order
through the honour of man. But the native soul of Germany was cut out
by the sword and replaced with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb349"
href="#v2pb349" name="v2pb349">349</a>]</span>a mongrel Hebrew-Latin
soul. The metaphorical terrors of tropical countries,&mdash;the deadly
worms, the burning and suffocating blasts and stenches, with which the
mind of those dwelling near them could familiarise itself when met with
in their scriptures, acquired exaggerated horrors when left to be
pictured by the terrorised imagination of races ignorant of their
origin. It is a long distance from Potsdam and Hyde Park to Zahara.
Christianity therefore blighted nature in the north by apparitions more
fearful than the southern world ever knew, and long after the pious
there could sing and dance, puritanical glooms hung over the Christians
of higher latitudes. When the progress of German culture began the work
of dissipating these idle terrors, the severity of the reaction was
proportioned to the intensity of the delusions. The long-famished
faculties rushed almost madly into their beautiful world, but without
the old reverence which had once knelt before its phenomena. That may
remain with a few, but the cynicism of the noisiest will be reflected
even upon the faces of the best. Goethe first had his attention drawn
to Spinoza by a portrait of him on a tract, in which his really noble
countenance was represented with a diabolical aspect. The orthodox had
made it, but they could only have done so by the careers of Faust,
Paracelsus, and their tribe. These too helped to conventionalise
Voltaire into a Mephistopheles.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e13753src"
href="#xd20e13753" name="xd20e13753src">8</a></p>
<p>Goethe was probably the first European man to carry out this
scepticism to its full results. He was the first who recognised that
the moral edifice based upon monastic theories must follow them; and he
had in his own life already questioned the right of the so-called
morality to its <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb350" href="#v2pb350"
name="v2pb350">350</a>]</span>supreme if not tyrannous authority over
man. Hereditary conscience, passing through this fierce crucible, lay
levigable before Goethe, to be swept away into dust-hole or moulded
into the image of reason. There remained around the animal nature of a
free man only a thread which seemed as fine as that which held the
monster Fenris. It was made only of the sentiment of love and that of
honour. But as Fenris found the soft invisible thread stronger than
chains, Faust proved the tremendous sanctions that surround the finer
instincts of man.</p>
<p>Emancipated from grey theory, Faust rushes hungrily at the golden
fruit of life. The starved passions will have their satisfaction, at
whatever cost to poor Gretchen. The fruit turns to ashes on his lips.
The pleasure is not that of the thinking man, but of the accomplished
poodle he has taken for his guide. To no moment in that intrigue can
the suffrage of his whole nature say, &lsquo;Stay, thou art
fair!&rsquo; That is the pact&mdash;it is the distinctive keynote of
Goethe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Faust.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Canst thou by falsehood or by flattery</p>
<p class="line">Make me one moment with myself at peace,</p>
<p class="line">Cheat me into tranquillity?&mdash;come then</p>
<p class="line">And welcome life&rsquo;s last day.</p>
<p class="line">Make me to the passing moment plead.</p>
<p class="line">Fly not, O stay, thou art so fair!</p>
<p class="line">Then will I gladly perish.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The pomp and power of the court, luxury and wealth,
equally fail to make the scholar at peace with himself. They are
symbolised in the paper money by which Mephistopheles replenished the
imperial exchequer. The only allusion to the printing-press, whose
inventor Fust had been somewhat associated with Faust, is to show its
power turned to the work of distributing irredeemable promises.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb351" href="#v2pb351" name=
"v2pb351">351</a>]</span></p>
<p>At length one demand made by Faust makes Mephistopheles tremble. As
a mere court amusement he would have him raise Helen of Troy. Reluctant
that Faust should look upon the type of man&rsquo;s harmonious
development, yet bound to obey, Mephistopheles sends him to
<span class="sc">the Mothers</span>,&mdash;the healthy primal instincts
and ideals of man which expressed themselves in the fair forms of art.
Corrupted by superstition of their own worshippers, cursed by
christianity, they &lsquo;have a Hades of their own,&rsquo; as
Mephistopheles says, and he is unwilling to interfere with them. The
image appears, and the sense of Beauty is awakened in Faust. But he is
still a christian as to his method: his idea is that heaven must be
taken by storm, by chance, wish, prayer, any means except patient
fulfilment of the conditions by which it may be reached. Helen is
flower of the history and culture of Greece; and so lightly Faust would
pluck and wear it!</p>
<p>Helen having vanished as he tried to clasp her, Faust has learned
his second lesson. When he next meets Helen it is not to seek
intellectual beauty as, in Gretchen&rsquo;s case, he had sought the
sensuous and sensual. He has fallen under a charm higher than that of
either Church or Mephistopheles; the divorce of ages between flesh and
spirit, the master-crime of superstition, from which all devils sprang,
was over for him from the moment that he sees the soul embodied and
body ensouled in the art-ideal of Greece.</p>
<p>The redemption of Faust through Art is the gospel of the nineteenth
century. This is her vesture which Helen leaves him when she vanishes,
and which bears him as a cloud to the land he is to make beautiful. The
purest Art&mdash;Greek Art&mdash;is an expression of Humanity: it can
as little be turned to satisfy a self-culture unhumanised as to consist
with a superstition which insults nature. When <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb352" href="#v2pb352" name=
"v2pb352">352</a>]</span>Faust can meet with Helen, and part without
any more clutching, he is not hurled back to his Gothic study and
mocking devil any more: he is borne away until he reaches the land
where his thought and work are needed. Blindness falls on him&mdash;or
what Theology deems such: for it is metaphorical&mdash;it means that he
has descended from clouds to the world, and the actual earth has
eclipsed a possible immortality.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The sphere of Earth is known enough to me;</p>
<p class="line">The view beyond is barred immortality:</p>
<p class="line">A fool who there his blinking eyes directeth,</p>
<p class="line">And o&rsquo;er his clouds of peers a place
expecteth!</p>
<p class="line">Firm let him stand and look around him well!</p>
<p class="line">This World means something to the capable;</p>
<p class="line">Why needs he through Eternity to wend?</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The eye for a fictitious world lost, leaves the vision
for reality clearer. In every hard chaotic object Faust can now detect
a slumbering beauty. The swamps and pools of the unrestrained sea, the
oppressed people, the barrenness and the flood, they are all paths to
Helen&mdash;a nobler Helen than Greece knew. When he has changed one
scene of Chaos into Order, and sees a free people tilling the happy
earth, then, indeed, he has realised the travail of his manhood, and is
satisfied. To a moment which Mephistopheles never brought him, he cries
&lsquo;Stay, thou art fair!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mephistopheles now, as becomes a creation of the Theology of
obtaining what is not earned, calls up infernal troops to seize
Faust&rsquo;s soul, but the angels pelt them with roses. The roses
sting them worse than flames. The roses which Faust has evoked from
briars are his defence: they are symbols of man completing his nature
by a self-culture which finds its satisfaction in making some outward
desert rejoice and blossom like the rose. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The most important remnant of the Odin myth is the
universal legend of the Wild Huntsman. The following variants are given
by Wuttke.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e13826src" href="#xd20e13826"
name="xd20e13826src">1</a> In Central and South Germany the Wild Hunt
is commonly called <span lang="de">W&uuml;tenden Heere</span>,
<i>i.e.</i>, Wodan&rsquo;s army or chase&mdash;called in the Middle
Ages, Wuotanges Heer. The hunter, generally supposed to be abroad
during the twelve nights after Christmas, is variously called
<span lang="xx">Wand, Waul, Wodej&auml;ger, Hellj&auml;ger,
Nightj&auml;ger, Hackelberg, Hackelberend</span> (man in armour),
<span lang="xx">Fro Gode, Banditterich, Jenner</span>. The most common
belief is that he is the spectre of a wicked lord or king who
sacrilegiously enjoyed the chase on Sundays and other holy days, and
who is condemned to expiate his sin by hunting till the day of doom. He
wears a broad-brimmed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb354" href=
"#v2pb354" name="v2pb354">354</a>]</span>hat; is followed by dogs and
other animals, fiery, and often three-legged; and in his spectral train
are the souls of unbaptized children, huntsmen who have trodden down
grain, witches, and others&mdash;these being mounted on horses, goats,
and cocks, and sometimes headless, or with their entrails dragging
behind them. They rush with a fearful noise through the air, which
resounds with the cracking of whips, neighing of horses, barking of
dogs, and cries of ghostly huntsmen. The unlucky wight encountered is
caught up into the air, where his neck is wrung, or he is dropped from
a great height. In some regions, it is said, such must hunt until
relieved, but are not slain. The huntsman is a Nemesis on poachers or
trespassers in woods and forests. Sometimes the spectres have combats
with each other over battlefields. Their track is marked with bits of
horseflesh, human corpses, legs with shoes on. In some regions, it is
said, the huntsmen carry battle-axes, and cut down all who come in
their way. When the hunt is passing all dogs on earth become still and
quiet. In most regions there is some haunted gorge, hill, or castle in
which the train disappears.</p>
<p>In Thuringia, it is said that, when the fearful noises of the
spectral hunt come very near, they change to ravishing music. In the
same euphemistic spirit some of the prognostications it brings are not
evil: generally, indeed, the apparition portends war, pestilence, and
famine, but frequently it announces a fruitful year. If, in passing a
house, one of the train dips his finger in the yeast, the staff of life
will never be wanting in that house. Whoever sees the chase will live
long, say the Bohemians; but he must not hail it, lest flesh and bones
rain upon him.</p>
<p>In most regions, however, there is thought to be great danger in
proximity to the hunt. The perils are guarded against by prostration on
the earth face downward, praying <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb355"
href="#v2pb355" name="v2pb355">355</a>]</span>meanwhile; by standing on
a white cloth (Bertha&rsquo;s linen), or wrapping the same around the
head; by putting the head between the spokes of a wheel; by placing
palm leaves on a table. The hunt may be observed securely from the
cross-roads, which it shuns, or by standing on a stump marked with
three crosses&mdash;as is often done by woodcutters in South
Germany.</p>
<p>Wodan also appears in the <span lang=
"de">Schimmelreiter</span>&mdash;headless rider on a white horse, in
Swabia called <span lang="de">Bachreiter</span> or <span lang=
"de">Junker J&auml;kele</span>. This apparition sometimes drives a
carriage drawn by four white (or black) horses, usually headless. He is
the terrible forest spectre Hoimann, a giant in broad-brimmed hat, with
moss and lichen for beard; he rides a headless white horse through the
air, and his wailing cry, &lsquo;Hoi, hoi!&rsquo; means that his reign
is ended. He is the bugbear of children.</p>
<p>In the Odinwald are the <i lang="de">Riesen&auml;ule</i> and
<i lang="de">Riesenaltar</i>, with mystic marks declaring them relics
of a temple of Odin. Near Erbach is Castle Rodenstein, the very
fortress of the Wild J&auml;ger, to which he passes with his horrid
train from the ruins of Schnellert. The village of Reichelsheim has on
file the affidavits of the people who heard him just before the battles
of Leipzig and Waterloo. Their theory is that if the J&auml;ger returns
swiftly to Schnellert all will go well for Germany; but if he tarry at
Rodenstein &rsquo;tis an omen of evil. He was reported near Frankfort
in 1832; but it is notable that no mention of him was made during the
late Franco-German war.</p>
<p>A somewhat later and rationalised variant relates that the wild
huntsman was Hackelberg, the Lord of Rodenstein, whose
tomb&mdash;really a Druidical stone&mdash;is shown at the castle, and
said to be guarded by hell-hounds. Hackelberg is of old his Brunswick
name. It was the Hackelberg Hill that opened to receive the children,
which the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb356" href="#v2pb356" name=
"v2pb356">356</a>]</span>Pied Piper of Hamelin charmed away with his
flute from that old town, because the corporation would not pay him
what they had promised for ridding them of rats. It is easy to trace
this Pied Piper, who has become so familiar through Mr. Robert
Browning&rsquo;s charming poem, to the Odin of more blessed memory, who
says in the Havamal, &lsquo;I know a song by which I soften and enchant
my enemies, and render their weapons of no effect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This latter aspect of Odin, his command over vermin, connects him
with the Slavonic Lyeshy, or forest-demon of the Russias. The ancient
thunder-god of Russia, Perun, who rides in his storm-chariot through
the sky, has in the more christianised districts dropped his mantle on
Ilya (Elias); while in the greater number of Slavonic districts he has
held his original physical characters so remarkably that it has been
necessary to include him among demons. In Slavonian Folklore the
familiar myth of the wild huntsman is distributed&mdash;Vladimir the
Great fulfils one part of it by still holding high revel in the halls
of Kief, but he is no huntsman; Perun courses noisily through the air,
but he is rather benevolent than otherwise; the diabolical
characteristics of the superstition have fallen to the evil huntsmen
(Lyeshies), who keep the wild creatures as their flocks, the same as
shepherds their herds, and whom every huntsman must propitiate. The
Lyeshy is gigantic, wears a sheepskin, has one eye without eyebrow or
eyelash, horns, feet of a goat, is covered with green hair, and his
finger-nails are claws. He is special protector of the bears and
wolves.</p>
<p>In Denmark the same myth appears as King Volmer&rsquo;s Hunt.
Waldemar was so passionately fond of the chase that he said if the Lord
would only let him hunt for ever near Gurre (his castle in the north of
Seeland), he would not envy him his paradise. For this blasphemous wish
he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb357" href="#v2pb357" name=
"v2pb357">357</a>]</span>is condemned to hunt between Burre and Gurre
for ever. His cavalcade is much like that already described. Volmer
rides a snow-white charger, preceded by a pack of coal-black hounds,
and he carries his head under his left arm. On St. John the women open
gates for him. It is believed that he is allowed brief repose at one
and another of his old seats, and it is said spectral servants are
sometimes seen preparing the ruined castle at Vordingborg for him, or
at Waldemar&rsquo;s Tower. A sceptical peasant resolved to pass the
night in this tower. At midnight the King entered, and, thanking him
for looking after his tower, gave him a gold piece which burned through
his hand and fell to the ground as a coal. On the other hand, Waldemar
sometimes makes peasants hold his dogs, and afterwards throws them
coals which turn out to be gold pieces.</p>
<p>The Palnatoke or Palne Hunter appears mostly in the island of
<i>Fuen</i>. Every New Year&rsquo;s night he supplies himself with
three horse-shoes from some smithy, and the smith takes care that he
may find them ready for use on his anvil, as he always leaves three
gold pieces in their stead. If the shoes are not ready for him, he
carries the anvil off. In one instance he left an anvil on the top of a
church tower, and it caused the smith great trouble to get it down
again.</p>
<p>King Abel was interred after his death in St. Peter&rsquo;s Church
in Sleswig, but the fratricide could find no peace in his grave. His
ghost walked about in the night and disturbed the monks in their
devotions. The body was finally removed from the church, and sunk in a
foul bog near Gottorp. To keep him down effectively, a pointed stake
was drove through his body. The spot is still called K&ouml;nigsgrabe.
Notwithstanding this, he appears seated on a coal-black charger,
followed by a pack of black hounds <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb358" href="#v2pb358" name="v2pb358">358</a>]</span>with eyes and
tongues of fire. The gates are heard slamming and opening, and the
shrieks and yells are such that they appal the stoutest hearts.</p>
<p>At the ancient capital of Fuen, Odense, said to have been built by
Odin, the myth has been reduced to a spectral Christmas-night equipage,
which issues from St. Canute&rsquo;s Church and passes to the ancient
manor-house of Glorup. It is a splendid carriage, drawn by six black
horses with fiery tongues, and in it are seated the Lords of Glorup,
famous for their cruelty to peasants, and now not able to rest in the
church where they were interred. It is of evil omen to witness the
spectacle: a man who watched for it was struck blind.</p>
<p>In France <i lang="fr">Le Grand Veneur</i> bears various names; he
is King Arthur, Saint Hubert, Hugo. His alleged appearances within
historic times have been so strongly attested that various attempts
have been made to give them rational explanations. Thus Charles VI. of
France, when going to war in Bretagne, is said to have been met by such
a spectre in the Forest of Mans, and became insane; he believed himself
to have been the victim of sorcery, as did many of his subjects. It has
been said that the King was met by a disguised emissary of the Duc de
Bretagne. More particular accounts are given of the apparition of the
Wild Huntsman to Henry IV. when he was hunting with the Comte de
Soissons in the Forest of Fontainebleau, an event commemorated by
&lsquo;<span lang="fr">La Croix du Grand Veneur</span>.&rsquo;
According to Matthieu,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e13901src" href=
"#xd20e13901" name="xd20e13901src">2</a> both the King and the Count
heard the cries of the hunt, and when the Count went to discover their
origin, the terrible dark figure stood forth and cried, &lsquo;You wish
to see me, then behold!&rsquo; This incident has been explained
variously, as a project of assassination, or as the jest of two fellows
who, in 1596, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb359" href="#v2pb359"
name="v2pb359">359</a>]</span>were amusing Paris by their skill in
imitating all the sounds of a hunt. But such phantoms had too long
hunted through the imagination of the French peasantry for any
explanation to be required. Robert le Diable, wandering in Normandy
till judgment-day, and King Arthur, at an early date domesticated in
France as a spectral huntsman (the figure most popularly identified at
the time with the phantom seen by Henry IV.), are sufficient
explanations. The ruins of Arthur&rsquo;s Castle near Huelgoat,
Finist&egrave;re, were long believed to hide enormous treasures,
guarded by demons, who appear sometimes as fiery lights (<i lang=
"la">ignes fatuui</i>), owls, buzzards, and ravens&mdash;one of the
latter being the form in which Arthur comes from his happy Vale of
Avallon, when he would vary its repose with a hunt.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e13913src" href="#xd20e13913" name="xd20e13913src">3</a></p>
<p>A sufficiently curious interchange of such superstitions
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb360" href="#v2pb360" name=
"v2pb360">360</a>]</span>is represented in the following extract from
Surtees:&mdash;&lsquo;<span lang="en-1600">Sir Anthon Bek, busshop of
Dureme in the tyme of King Eduarde, the son of King Henry, was the
maist prowd and masterfull busshop in all England, and it was

chaunced that emong other lewd persons, this sir Anthon entertained at
his court one Hugh de Pountchardon, that for his evill deeds and
manifold robberies had been driven out of the Inglische courte, and had
come from the southe to seek a little bread, and to live by staylinge.
And to this Hughe, whom also he imployed to good purpose in the warr of
Scotland, the busshop gave the land of Thikley, since of him called
Thikley-Puntchardon, and also made him his chiefe huntsman. And after,
this blake Hughe died afore the busshop; and efter that the busshop
chasid the wild hart in Galtres forest, and sodainly ther met with him
Hugh de Pontchardon, that was afore deid, on a wythe horse; and the
said Hughe loked earnestly on the busshop, and the busshop said unto
him, &lsquo;Hughe, what makethe thee here?&rsquo; and he spake never

<p>The legend of the Wild Huntsman tinges many old English stories.
Herne, the Hunter, may be identified with him, and the demons, with
ghostly and headless wish-hounds, who still hunt evil-doers over
Dartmoor on stormy nights, are his relations. The withered look of
horses grazing on Penzance Common was once explained by their being
ridden by demons, and the fire-breathing horse has found its way by
many weird routes to the service of the Exciseman in the
&lsquo;Ingoldsby Legends,&rsquo; or that of Earl Garrett, who rides
round the Curragh of Kildare on a steed whose inch-thick silver shoes
must wear as thin as a cat&rsquo;s ear, ere he fights the English and
reigns over Ireland. The Teutonic myth appears very plainly in the
story of Tregeagle. This man, traced to an old Cornish family, is said
to have been one of the wickedest men that ever lived; but though he
had disposed of his soul to the Devil, the evil one was baulked by the
potency of St. Petroc. This, however, was on condition of
Tregeagle&rsquo;s labouring at the impossible task of clearing the sand
from Porthcurnow Cove, at which work he may still be heard groaning
when wind and wave are high. Whenever he tries to snatch a
moment&rsquo;s rest, the demon is at liberty to pursue him, and they
may be heard on stormy nights in hot pursuit of the poor creature,
whose bull-like roar passed into the Cornish proverb, &lsquo;to roar
like Tregeagle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On a pleasant Sunday evening in July 1868, I witnessed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb362" href="#v2pb362" name=
"v2pb362">362</a>]</span>&lsquo;<span lang="de">Der
Freisch&uuml;tz</span>&rsquo; in the newly-opened opera-house at
Leipzig. Never elsewhere have I seen such completeness and splendour in
the weird effects of the infernal scene in the Wolf&rsquo;s Glen. The
&lsquo;White Lady&rsquo; started forth at every step of <span class=
"corr" id="xd20e13970" title=
"Source: Caspar&rsquo;s">Rodolph&rsquo;s</span> descent to the glen,
warning him back. Zamiel, instead of the fiery garb he once wore as
Sama&euml;l, was arrayed in raiment black as night; and when the magic
bullet was moulded, the stage swarmed with huge reptiles, fiery
serpents crawled on the ground, a dragon-drawn chariot, with wheels of
fire, driven by a skeleton, passed through the air; and the wild
huntsman&rsquo;s chase, composed of animals real to the eye and
uttering their distinguishable cries, hurried past. The animals
represented were the horse, hound, boar, stag, chamois, raven, bat,
owl, and they rushed amid the wild blast of horns.</p>
<p>I could but marvel at the yet more strange and weird history of the
human imagination through which had flitted, from the varied regions of
a primitive world, the shapes combined in this apotheosis of diablerie.
Probably if Elijah in his fire-chariot, preached about in the
neighbouring church that morning, and this wild huntsman careering in
the opera, had looked closely at each other and at their own history,
they might have found a common ancestor in the mythical Mahan Bali of
India, the king whose austerities raised in power till he excited the
jealousy of the gods, until Vishnu crushed him with his heel into the
infernal regions, where he still exercises sovereignty, and is
permitted to issue forth for an annual career (at the Onam festival),
as described in Southey&rsquo;s &lsquo;Curse of Kehama.&rsquo; And they
might probably both claim mythological relationship with Yami, lord of
death, who, as Jami, began in Persia the career of all warriors that
never died, but sometimes sleep till a magic horn <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb363" href="#v2pb363" name=
"v2pb363">363</a>]</span>shall awaken them, sometimes dwell, like Jami
himself and King Arthur, in happy isles, and in other cases issue forth
at certain periods for the chase or for war&mdash;like Odin and
Waldemar&mdash;with an infernal train.</p>
<p>But how did these mighty princes and warriors become demon
huntsmen?</p>
<p>In the Persian &lsquo;Desatir&rsquo; it is related that the animals
contested the superiority of man, the two orders of beings being
represented by their respective sages, and the last animal to speak
opposed the claim of his opponent that man attained elevation to the
nature of angels, with the remark, &lsquo;In his putting to death of
animals and similar acts man resembleth the beasts of prey, and not
angels.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The prophet of the world then said, &lsquo;We deem it sinful to kill
harmless, but right to slay ravenous, animals. Were all ravenous
animals to enter into a compact not to kill harmless animals, we would
abstain from slaying them, and hold them dear as ourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Upon this the wolf made a treaty with the ram, and the lion became
friend of the stag. No tyranny was left in the world, till man (Dehak)
broke the treaty and began to kill animals. In consequence of this,
none observed the treaty except the harmless animals.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e13986src" href="#xd20e13986" name="xd20e13986src">4</a></p>
<p>This fable, from the Aryan side, may be regarded as showing the
reason of the evil repute which gathered around the name of Dehak or
Zohak. The eating of animal food was among our Aryan ancestors probably
the provisional commissariat of a people migrating from their original
<i>habitat</i>. The animals slain for food had all their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb364" href="#v2pb364" name=
"v2pb364">364</a>]</span>original consecration, and even the ferocious
were largely invested with awe. The woodcutters of Bengal invoke
Kalrayu&mdash;an archer tiger-mounted&mdash;to protect them against the
wild beasts he (a form of Siva) is supposed to exterminate; but while
the exterminator of the most dangerous animals may, albeit without
warrant in the Shastr, be respected in India, the huntsman is generally
of evil repute. The gentle Krishna was said to have been slain by an
arrow from the bow of Ungudu, a huntsman, who left the body to rot
under a tree where it fell, the bones being the sacred relics for which
the image of Jugernath at Orissa was constructed.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e13996src" href="#xd20e13996" name="xd20e13996src">5</a></p>
<p>It is not known at what period the notion of transmigration arose,
but that must have made him appear cannibalistic who first hunted and
devoured animals. Such was the Persian Zohak (or Dehak). His Babylonian
form, Nimrod, represented also the character of Esau, as huntsman; that
is, the primitive enemy of the farmer, and of the commerce in grains;
the preserver of wildness, and consequently of all those primitive
aboriginal idolatries which linger in the heaths (whence heathen) and
country villages (whence pagans) long after they have passed away from
the centres of civilisation. Hunting is essentially barbarous. The
willingness of some huntsmen even now, when this serious occupation of
an early period has become a sport, to sacrifice not only animal life
to their pleasure, but also the interests of labour and agriculture,
renders it very easy for us to understand the transformation of Nimrod
into a demon. In the Hebrew and Arabian legends concerning Nimrod, that
&lsquo;mighty hunter&rsquo; is shown as <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb365" href="#v2pb365" name="v2pb365">365</a>]</span>related to the
wild elements and their worshipper. When Abraham, having broken the
images of his father, was brought by Terah before Nimrod, the King
said, &lsquo;Let us worship the fire!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rather the water that quenches the fire,&rsquo; said
Abraham.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, the water.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rather the cloud that carries the water.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, the cloud.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rather the wind that scatters the cloud.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, the wind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rather man, for he withstands the wind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou art a babbler,&rsquo; said Nimrod. &lsquo;I worship the
fire and will cast thee into it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Abraham was cast into the fiery furnace by Nimrod, and on the
seventh day after was found sitting amid the roses of a garden, the
mighty hunter&mdash;hater of gardens&mdash;resolved on a daring hunt
for Abraham&rsquo;s God himself. He built a tower five thousand cubits
high, but finding heaven still far away, he attached a car to two
half-starved eagles, and by holding meat above them they flew upward,
until Nimrod heard a voice saying, &lsquo;Godless man, whither goest
thou?&rsquo; The audacious man shot an arrow in the direction of the
voice; the arrow returned to him stained with blood, and Nimrod
believed that he had wounded Abraham&rsquo;s God.</p>
<p>He who hunted the universe was destroyed by one of the weakest of
animated beings&mdash;a fly. In the aspiring fly which attacked
Nimrod&rsquo;s lip, and then nose, and finally devoured his brain, the
Moslem and Hebrew doctors saw the fittest end of one whose adventurous
spirit had not stopped to attack animals, man, Abraham, and Allah
himself.</p>
<p>But though, in one sense, destroyed, Nimrod, say various myths, may
be heard tumbling and groaning about the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb366" href="#v2pb366" name="v2pb366">366</a>]</span>base of his
tower of Babel, where the confusion of tongues took place; and it might
be added, that they have, like the groan, a meaning irrespective of
race or language. Dehak and Nimrod have had their brothers in every
race, which has ever reached anything that may be called civilisation.
It was the barbaric Baron and the Robber Knight of the Middle Ages,
living by the hunt, who, before conversion, made for the Faithful
Eckhardts of the Church the chief impediment; they might then strike
down the monk, whose apparition has always been the legendary warning
of the Demon&rsquo;s approach. When the Eckhardts had baptized these
knights, they had already been transformed to the Devils which people
the forests of Germany, France, and England with their terrible
spectres. The wild fables of the East, telling of fell Demons coursing
through the air, whispered to the people at one ear, and the equally
wild deeds of the Robber Knights at the other. The Church had given the
people one name for all such phantasms&mdash;Devil&mdash;and it was a
name representative of the feelings of both priest and peasant, so long
as the Robber Knights were their common enemy. Jesus had to be a good
deal modified before he could become the model of this Teutonic Esau.
It is after the tradition of his old relation to huntsmen that the
Devil has been so especially connected in folklore with soldiers. In
the &lsquo;Annals of Leipzig,&rsquo; kept in Auerbach&rsquo;s Cellar,
famous for the flight of Mephisto and Faust from its window on a
wine-cask, I found two other instances in which the Devil was reported
as having appeared in that town. In one case (1604), the fiend had
tempted one Jeremy of Strasburg, a marksman, to commit suicide, but
that not succeeding, had desired him to go with him to the neighbouring
castle and enjoy some fruit. The marksman was saved by help of a Dean.
In 1633, during a period of excessive cold and snow, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb367" href="#v2pb367" name=
"v2pb367">367</a>]</span>Devil induced a soldier to blaspheme. The
marksman and the soldier were, indeed, the usual victims of the Wild
Huntsmen&rsquo;s temptations; and it was for such that the unfailing
magic bullets were moulded in return for their impawned souls.</p>
<p>How King Olaf&mdash;whose name lingers among us in &lsquo;Tooley
Street,&rsquo; so famous for its Three Tailors!<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e14032src" href="#xd20e14032" name=
"xd20e14032src">6</a>&mdash;spread the Gospel through the North after
his baptism in England is well known. Whatever other hunt may have been
phantasmal, it was not Olaf&rsquo;s hunt of the heathen. To put a pan
of live coals under the belly of one, to force an adder down the throat
of another, to offer all men the alternatives of being baptized or
burnt, were the arguments which this apostle applied with such energy
that at last&mdash;but not until many brave martyrdoms&mdash;the chief
people were convinced. Olaf encountered Odin as if he had been a living
foe, and what is more, believed in the genuine existence of his former
God. Once, as Olaf and his friends believed, Odin appeared to this
devastator of his altars as a one-eyed man in broad-brimmed hat,
delighting the King in his hours of relaxation with that enchanting
conversation for which he was so famous. But he (Odin) tried secretly
to induce the cook to prepare for his royal master some fine meat which
he had poisoned. But Olaf said, &lsquo;Odin shall not deceive
us,&rsquo; and ordered the tempting viand to be thrown away. Odin was
god of the barbarian Junkers, and the people rejoiced that he was
driven into holes and corners; his rites remained mainly among
huntsmen, and had to be kept very secret. In the <i>Gulathings
Lagen</i> of Norway it is ordered: &lsquo;Let the king and bishop, with
all possible care, search after those who exercise pagan rites, who use
magic arts, who adore the genii of particular places, of tombs, or
rivers, and who, after the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb368" href=
"#v2pb368" name="v2pb368">368</a>]</span>manner of devils in
travelling, are transported from place to place through the
air.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Under such very actual curses as these, the once sacred animals of
Odin, and all the associations of the hunt, were diabolised. Even the
hunting-horn was regarded as having something pr&aelig;ternatural about
it. The howling blast when Odin consulteth Mimir&rsquo;s head<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e14042src" href="#xd20e14042" name=
"xd20e14042src">7</a> was heard again in the Pied Piper&rsquo;s flute,
and passed southward to blend its note with the horn of Roland at
Roncesvalles,&mdash;which brought help from distances beyond the reach
of any honest horn, and even with the pipe of Pan.</p>
<p>That the Edda described Odin as mounted on a mysterious horse, as
cherishing two wolves for pets, having a roasted boar for the daily
<i lang="fr">pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i> of his table, and
with a raven on either shoulder, whispering to him the secret affairs
of the earth, was enough to settle the reputation of those animals in
the creed of christian priests. The Raven was, indeed, from of old
endowed with the holy awfulness of the christian dove, in the Norse
Mythology. To this day no Swede will kill a raven. The superstition
concerning it was strong enough to transmit even to Voltaire an
involuntary shudder at its croak. Odin was believed to have given the
Raven the colour of the night that it might the better spy out the
deeds of darkness. Its &lsquo;natural theology&rsquo; is, no doubt,
given correctly by Robert Browning&rsquo;s Caliban, who, when his
speculations are interrupted by a thunderstorm, supposes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb369" href="#v2pb369" name=
"v2pb369">369</a>]</span>his soliloquy has been conveyed by the raven
he sees flying to his god Setebos. In many parts of Germany ravens are
believed to hold souls of the damned. If a raven&rsquo;s heart be
secured it procures an unerring shot.</p>
<p>From an early date the Boar became an ensign of the prowess of the
gods, by which its head passed to be the device of so many barbaric
clans and ancient families in the Northern world. In Vedic Mythology we
find Indra taking the shape of a Wild Boar, also killing a demon Boar,
and giving Tritas the strength by which a similar monster is
slain.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e14076src" href="#xd20e14076" name=
"xd20e14076src">8</a> According to another fable, while Brahma and
Vishnu are quarrelling as to which is the first-born, Siva interferes
and cries, &lsquo;I am the first-born; nevertheless I will recognise as
my superior him who is able to see the summit of my head or the sole of
my feet.&rsquo; Vishnu, transforming himself to a Boar, pierced the
ground, penetrated to the infernal regions, and then saw the feet of
Siva, who on his return saluted him as first-born of the gods. De
Gubernatis regards this fable as making the Boar emblem of the hidden
Moon.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e14079src" href="#xd20e14079" name=
"xd20e14079src">9</a> He is hunted by the Sun. He guards the treasure
of the demons which Indra gains by slaying him. In Sicilian story,
Zafarana, by throwing three hog&rsquo;s bristles on embers, renews her
husband&rsquo;s youth. In Esthonian legend, a prince, by eating pork,
acquires the faculty of understanding the language of
birds,&mdash;which may mean leading on the spring with its songs of
birds. But whether these particular interpretations be true or not,
there is no doubt that the Boar, at an early period, became emblematic
of the wild forces of nature, and from being hunted by King Odin on
earth passed to be his favourite food in Valhalla, and a prominent
figure in his spectral hunt.</p>
<p>Enough has already been said of the Dog in several <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb370" href="#v2pb370" name=
"v2pb370">370</a>]</span>chapters of this work to render it but natural
that this animal should take his place in any diabolical train. It was
not as a &lsquo;hell-hound,&rsquo; or descendant of the guardians of
Orcus, that he entered the spectral procession of Odin, but as
man&rsquo;s first animal assistant in the work of obtaining a living
from nature. It is the faithful friend of man who is demoralised in
Waldemar&rsquo;s Lystig, the spectre-hound of Peel Castle, the Manthe
Doog of the Isle of Man, the sky-dogs (Cwn wybir or aunwy) of Wales,
and Roscommon dog of Ireland.</p>
<p>Of the Goat, the Dog, and some other diabolised animals, enough has
been said in previous pages. The nocturnal animals would be as
naturally caught up into the Wild Huntsman&rsquo;s train as belated
peasants. But it is necessary to dwell a little on the relations of the
Horse to this Wild Hunt. It was the Horse that made the primitive king
among men.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Horse,&rsquo; says Dasent, &lsquo;was a sacred animal
among the Teutonic tribes from the first moment of their appearance in
history; and Tacitus has related how, in the shade of those woods and
groves which served them for temples, white horses were fed at the
public cost, whose backs no mortal crossed, whose neighings and
snortings were carefully watched as auguries and omens, and who were
thought to be conscious of divine mysteries. In Persia, too, the
classical reader will remember how the neighing of a horse decided the
choice for the crown. Here in England, at any rate, we have only to
think of Hengist and Horsa, the twin heroes of the Anglo-Saxon
migration&mdash;as the legend ran&mdash;heroes whose name meant
<i>horse</i>, and of the Vale of the White Horse, in Berks, where the
sacred form still gleams along the down, to be reminded of the
sacredness of the horse to our forefathers. The Eddas are filled with
the names of famous horses, and the Sagas <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb371" href="#v2pb371" name="v2pb371">371</a>]</span>contain many
stories of good steeds, in whom their owners trusted and believed as
sacred to this or that particular god. Such a horse is Dapplegrimm in
the Norse tales, who saves his master out of all his perils, and brings
him to all fortune, and is another example of that mysterious
connection with the higher powers which animals in all ages have been
supposed to possess.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was believed that no warrior could approach Valhalla except on
horseback, and the steed was generally buried with his master. The
Scandinavian knight was accustomed to swear &lsquo;by the shoulder of a
horse and the edge of a sword.&rsquo; Odin (the god) was believed to
have always near him the eight-legged horse Sleipnir, whose sire was
the wonderful Svaldilfari, who by night drew the enormous stones for
the fortress defending Valhalla from the frost-giants. On Sleipnir the
deity rode to the realm of Hela, when he evoked the spirit of the
deceased prophetess, Vala, with Runic incantations, to learn
Baldur&rsquo;s fate. This is the theme of the Veytamsvida, paraphrased
by Gray in his ode beginning&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Up rose the king of men with speed,</p>
<p class="line">And saddled straight his coal-black steed</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The steed, however, was not black, but grey. Sleipnir
was the foal of a magically-created mare. The demon-mare (Mara) holds a
prominent place in Scandinavian superstition, besetting sleepers. In
the Ynglinga Saga, Vanland awakes from sleep, crying, &lsquo;Mara is
treading on me!&rsquo; His men hasten to help him, but when they take
hold of his head Mara treads on his legs, and when they hold his legs
she tramples on his head; and so, says Thiodolf&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Trampled to death, to Skyta&rsquo;s shore</p>

<p>All this is, of course, the origin of the common superstition of the
nightmare. The horse-shoe used against witches is from the same region.
We may learn here also the reason why hippophagy has been so long
unknown among us. Odin&rsquo;s boar has left his head on our Christmas
tables, but Olaf managed to rob us of the horse-flesh once eaten in
honour of that god. In the eleventh century he proclaimed the eating of
horse-flesh a test of paganism, as baptism was of Christianity, and
punished it with death, except in Iceland, where it was permitted by an
express stipulation on their embracing Christianity. To these facts it
may be added that originally the horse&rsquo;s head was lifted, as the
horse-shoe is now, for a charm against witches. When Wittekind fought
twenty years against Charlemagne, the ensign borne by his Saxon
followers was a horse&rsquo;s head raised on a pole. A white horse on a
yellow ground is to-day the Hanoverian banner, its origin being
undoubtedly Odinistic.</p>
<p>The christian edict against the eating of horse-flesh had probably a
stronger motive than sentimental opposition to paganism. A Roman
emperor had held the stirrup for a christian pontiff to mount, and
something of the same kind occurred in the North. The Horse, which had
been a fire-breathing devil under Odin, became a steed of the Sun under
the baptized noble and the bishop. Henceforth we read of coal-black and
snow-white horses, as these are mounted in the interest of the old
religion or the new.</p>
<p>It is very curious to observe how far and wide has gone religious
competition for possession of that living tower of strength&mdash;the
Horse. In ancient Ceylon we find the Buddhist immigrants winning over
the steed on which the aborigines were fortified. It was a white horse,
of course, that became their symbol of triumph. The old record
says&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb373" href="#v2pb373"
name="v2pb373">373</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;A certain yakkhini (demoness) named Chetiya, having the form
and countenance of a mare, dwelt near the marsh of Tumbariungona. A
certain person in the prince&rsquo;s (Pandukabhayo) retinue having seen
this beautiful (creature), white with red legs, announced the
circumstance to the prince. The prince set out with a rope to secure
her. She seeing him approach from behind, losing her presence of mind
from fear, under the influence of his imposing appearance, fled without
(being able to exert the power she possessed of) rendering herself
invisible. He gave chase to the fugitive. She, persevering in her
flight, made the circuit of the marsh seven times. She made three more
circuits of the marsh, and then plunged into the river at the
Kachchhaka ferry. He did the same, and (in the river) seized her by the
tail, and (at the same time grasped) the leaf of a palmira tree which
the stream was carrying down. By his supernatural good fortune this
(leaf) became an enormous sword. Exclaiming, &lsquo;I put thee to
death!&rsquo; he flourished the sword over her. &lsquo;Lord!&rsquo;
replied she to him, &lsquo;subduing this kingdom for thee, I will
confer it on thee: spare me my life.&rsquo; Seizing her by the throat,
and with the point of the sword boring her nostril, he secured her with
his rope: she (instantly) became tractable. Conducting her to the
Dhumarakkho mountain, he obtained a great accession of warlike power by
making her his battle-steed.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e14124src" href="#xd20e14124" name="xd20e14124src">10</a> The
wonderful victories won by the prince, aided by this magical mare, are
related, and the tale ends with his setting up &lsquo;within the royal
palace itself the mare-faced yakkhini,&rsquo; and providing for her
annually &lsquo;demon offerings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Equally ambiguous with the Horse in this zoologic diablerie is the
Stag. In the Heraklean legends we find <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb374" href="#v2pb374" name="v2pb374">374</a>]</span>that
hero&rsquo;s son, Telephon, nursed by a hind in the woods; and on the
other hand, his third &lsquo;labour&rsquo; was the capture of
Artemis&rsquo; gold-antlered stag, which brought on him her wrath (it
being &lsquo;her majesty&rsquo;s favourite stag&rsquo;). We have again
the story of Act&aelig;on pursuing the stag too far and suffering the
fate he had prepared for it; and a reminiscence of it in the
&lsquo;Pentamerone,&rsquo; when the demon Huoreo allures Canneloro into
the wood by taking the form of a beautiful hind. These complex legends
are reflected in Northern folklore also. Count Otto I. of Altmark,
while out hunting, slept under an oak and dreamed that he was furiously
attacked by a stag, which disappeared when he called on the name of
God. The Count built a monastery, which still stands, with the
oak&rsquo;s stump built into its altar. On the other hand, beside the
altar of a neighbouring church hang two large horns of a stag said to
have brought a lost child home on its back. Thus in the old town of
Steindal meet these contrary characters of the mystical stag, of which
it is not difficult to see that the evil one results from its
misfortune in being at once the huntsman&rsquo;s victim and
scapegoat.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e14131src" href="#xd20e14131"
name="xd20e14131src">11</a></p>
<p>In the legend of St. Hubert we have the sign of Christ&mdash;risen
from his tomb among the rich Christians to share for a little the
crucifixion of their first missionaries in the North&mdash;to the
huntsmen of Europe. Hubert pursues the stag till it turns to face him,
and behold, between its antlers, the cross! It is a fable conceived in
the spirit of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb375" href="#v2pb375"
name="v2pb375">375</a>]</span>him who said to fishermen, &lsquo;Come
with me and I will make you fishers of men.&rsquo; The effect was much
the same in both cases. Hubert kneels before the stag, and becomes a
saint, as the fishermen left their nets and became apostles. But, as
the proverb says, when the saint&rsquo;s day is over, farewell the
saint. The fishermen&rsquo;s successors caught men with iron hooks in
their jaws; the successors of Hubert hunted men and women so lustily
that they never paused long enough to see whether there might not be a
cross on their forehead also.</p>
<p>It was something, however, that the cross which Constantine could
only see in the sky could be seen by any eye on the forehead of a
harmless animal; and this not only because it marked the rising in
christian hearts of pity for the animals, but because what was done to
the flying stag was done to the peasant who could not fly, and more
terribly. The vision of Hubert came straight from the pagan heart of
Western and Northern Europe. In the Bible, from Genesis to Apocalypse,
no word is found clearly inculcating any duty to the animals. So
little, indeed, could the christians interpret the beautiful tales of
folklore concerning kindly beasts, out of which came the legend of
Hubert, that Hubert was made patron of huntsmen; and while, by a
popular development, Wodan was degraded to a devil, the baptized
sportsman rescued his chief occupation by ascribing its most dashing
legends to St. Martin and their inspiration to the Archangel
Michael.</p>
<p>It is now necessary to consider the light which the German heart
cast across the dark shadows of Wodan. This is to be discovered in the
myth of the White Lady. We have already seen, in the confessions of the
witches of Elfdale, in Sweden, that when they were gathering before
their formidable Devil, a certain White Spirit warned them back. The
children said she tried to keep them from <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb376" href="#v2pb376" name="v2pb376">376</a>]</span>entering the
Devil&rsquo;s Church at Blockula. This may not be worth much as a
&lsquo;confession,&rsquo; but it sufficiently reports the theories
prevailing in the popular mind of Elfdale at that time. It is not
doubtful now that this White Lady and that Devil she opposed were, in
pre-christian time, Wodan and his wife Frigga. The humble people who
had gladly given up the terrible huntsman and warrior to be degraded
into a Devil, and with him the barbaric Nimrods who worshipped him, did
not agree to a similar surrender of their dear household goddess, known
to them as Frigga, Holda, Bertha, Mother Rose,&mdash;under all her
epithets the Madonna of the North, interceding between them and the
hard king of Valhalla, ages before they ever heard of a jealous Jehovah
and a tender interceding Mary.</p>
<p>Dr. Wuttke has collected many variants of the myths of Frigga, some
of which bear witness to the efforts of the Church to degrade her also
into a fiend. She is seen washing white clothes at fountains, milking
cows, spinning flax with a distaff, or combing her flaxen hair. She was
believed to be the divine ancestress of the human race; many of the
oldest families claimed descent from her, and believed that this
<span lang="de">Ahnenfrau</span> announced to them good fortune, or, by
her wailing, any misfortune coming to their families. She brought evil
only to those who spoke evil of her. If any one shoots at her the ball
enters his own heart. She appears to poor wandering folk, especially
children, and guides them to spots where they find heaps of gold
covered with the flower called
&lsquo;Forget-me-not&rsquo;&mdash;because her gentle voice is heard
requesting, as the only compensation, that the flowers shall be
replaced when the gold is removed. The primroses are sacred to her, and
often are the keys (thence called &lsquo;key-blossoms&rsquo;) which
unlock her treasures. The smallest tribute she repays,&mdash;even a
pebble consecrated to her. Every child ascending <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb377" href="#v2pb377" name=
"v2pb377">377</a>]</span>the Burgeiser Alp places a stone on a certain
heap of such, with the words, &lsquo;Here I offer to the wild
maidens.&rsquo; These are Bertha&rsquo;s kindly fairies. (When
Frederika Bremer was with a picnic on the Hudson heights, which
Washington Irving had peopled with the Spirits he had brought from the
Rhine, she preferred to pour out her champagne as a libation to the
&lsquo;good spirits&rsquo; of Germany and America.) The beautiful White
Lady wears a golden chain, and glittering keys at her belt; she appears
at mid-day or in strong moonlight. In regions where priestly influence
is strong she is said to be half-black, half-white, and to appear
sometimes as a serpent. She often helps the weary farmer to stack his
corn, and sorely-tasked Cinderellas in their toil.</p>
<p>In pre-christian time this amiable goddess&mdash;called oftenest
Bertha (shining) and Mother Rose&mdash;was related to Wodan as the
spring and summer to the storms of winter, in which the Wild
Huntsman&rsquo;s procession no doubt originated. The Northman&rsquo;s
experience of seed-time and harvest was expressed in the myth of this
sweet Rose hidden through the winter&rsquo;s blight to rise again in
summer. This myth has many familiar variants, such as <span lang=
"de">Aschenputtel</span> and Sleeping Beauty; but it was more
particularly connected with the later legends of the White Lady, as
victim of the Wild Huntsman, by the stories of transformed princesses
delivered by youths. Rescue of the enchanted princess is usually
effected by three kisses, but she is compelled to appear before the
deliverer in some hideous aspect&mdash;as toad or serpent; so that he
is repelled or loses courage. This is the rose hid under the ugliness
of winter.</p>
<p>When the storm-god Wodan was banished from nature altogether and
identified with the imported, and naturally inconceivable, Satan, he
was no more regarded as Frigga&rsquo;s rough lord, but as her
remorseless foe. She was popularly <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb378" href="#v2pb378" name="v2pb378">378</a>]</span>revered as St.
Walpurga, the original May Queen, and it was believed that happy and
industrious children might sometimes see her on May-day with long
flowing flaxen hair, fine shoes, distaff in hand, and a golden crown on
her head. But for the nine nights after May-day she was relentlessly
pursued by the Wild Huntsman and his mounted train. There is a picture
by G. Watts of the hunted lady of Bocaccio&rsquo;s tale, now in the
Cosmopolitan Club of London, which vividly reproduces the weird
impressiveness of this myth. The White Lady tries to hide from her
pursuer in standing corn, or gets herself bound up in a sheaf. The Wild
Huntsman&rsquo;s wrath extends to all her retinue,&mdash;moss maidens
of the wood, or Holtzweibeln. The same belief characterises
Waldemar&rsquo;s hunt. It is a common legend in Denmark that King
Volmer rode up to some peasants, busy at harvest on Sobjerg Hill, and,
in reply to his question whether they had seen any game, one of the men
said&mdash;&lsquo;Something rustled just now in yonder standing
corn.&rsquo; The King rushed off, and presently a shot was heard. The
King reappeared with a mermaid lying across his horse, and said as he
passed, &lsquo;I have chased her a hundred years, and have her at
last.&rsquo; He then rode into the hill. In this way Frigga and her
little people, hunted with the wild creatures, awakened sympathy for
them.</p>
<p>The holy friar. Eckhardt (who may be taken as a myth and type of the
Church <i>ad hoc</i>) gained his legendary fame by being supposed to go
in advance of the Wild Huntsman and warn villagers of his approach; but
as time went on and a compromise was effected between the hunting
Barons and the Church, on the basis that the sports and cruelties
should be paid for with indulgence-fees, Eckhardt had to turn his
attention rather to the White Lady. She was declared a Wild Huntress,
but the epithet slipped to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb379" href=
"#v2pb379" name="v2pb379">379</a>]</span>other shoulders. The priests
identified her ultimately with Freija, or Frau Venus; and Eckhardt was
the holy hermit who warned young men against her sorceries in Venusberg
and elsewhere. But Eckhardt never prevailed against the popular love of
Mother Rose as he had against her pursuer; he only increased the
attractions of &lsquo;Frau Venus&rsquo; beyond her deserts. In the end
it was as much as the Church could do to secure for Mary the mantle of
her elder sister&rsquo;s sanctity. Even then the earlier faith was not
eradicated. After the altars of Mary had fallen, Frigga had vitality
enough to hold her own as the White Witch who broke the Dark
One&rsquo;s spells. It was chiefly this helpful Mother-goddess to whom
the wretched were appealing when they were burnt for witchcraft.</p>
<p>At Urselberg, Wurtemberg, there is a deep hole called the
&lsquo;Nightmaidens&rsquo; Retreat,&rsquo; in which are piled the
innumerable stones that have been cast therein by persons desiring good
luck on journeys. These stones correspond to the bones of the 11,000
Virgins in St. Ursula&rsquo;s Church at Cologne. The White Lady was
sainted under her name of Ursel (the glowing one), otherwise Horsel.
Horselberg, near Eisenach, became her haunt as Venus, the temptress of
Tannha&uuml;sers; Urselberg became her retreat as the good fairy
mother; but the attractions of herself and her moss-maidens, which the
Church wished to borrow, were taken on a long voyage to Rome, and there
transmuted to St. Ursula and her 11,000 Virgins. These Saints of
Cologne encountered their ancient mythical pursuers&mdash;the Wild
Huntsman&rsquo;s train&mdash;in those barbarian Huns who are said to
have slaughtered them all because they would not break their vows of
chastity. The legend is but a variant of Wodan&rsquo;s hunt after the
White Lady and her maidens. When it is remembered that before her
transformation by Christianity Ursula was the Huntsman&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb380" href="#v2pb380" name=
"v2pb380">380</a>]</span>own wife, Frigga, a quaint incident appears in
the last meeting between the two. After Wodan had been transformed to
the Devil, he is said to have made out the architectural plan for
Cologne Cathedral, and offered it to the architect in return for a bond
for his soul; but, having weakly allowed him to get possession of the
document before the bond was signed, the architect drew from under his
gown a bone of St. Ursula, from which the Devil fled in great terror.
It was bone of his bone; but after so many mythological vicissitudes
Wodan and his Horsel could hardly be expected to recognise each other
at this chance meeting in Cologne. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

universal myth of Sleepers,&mdash;christianised in the myth of St.
John, and of the Seven whose slumber is traceable as far as
Tours,&mdash;had a direct pagan development in Jami, Barbarossa,
Arthur, and their many variants. It is the legend of the Castle of
Sewingshields in Northumberland, that King Arthur, his queen and court,
remain there in a subterranean hall, entranced, until some one should
first blow a bugle-horn near the entrance hall, and then with
&lsquo;the sword of the stone&rsquo; cut a garter placed there beside
it. But none had ever heard where the entrance to this enchanted hall
was, till a farmer, fifty years since, was sitting knitting on the
ruins of the castle, and his clew fell and ran downwards through briars
into a deep subterranean passage. He cleared the portal of its weeds
and rubbish, and entering a vaulted passage, followed the clew. The
floor was infested with toads and lizards; and bats flitted fearfully
around him. At length his sinking courage was strengthened by a dim,
distant light, which, as he advanced, grew gradually brighter, till all
at once he entered a vast and vaulted hall, in the centre of which a
fire, without fuel, from a broad crevice in the floor, blazed with a
high and lambent flame, that showed all the carved walls and fretted
roof, and the monarch and his queen and court reposing around in a
theatre of thrones and costly couches. On the floor, beyond the fire,
lay the faithful and deep-toned pack of thirty couple of hounds; and on
a table before it the spell-dissolving horn, sword, and garter. The
shepherd firmly grasped the sword, and as he drew it from its rusty
scabbard the eyes of the monarch and his courtiers began to open, and
they rose till they sat upright. He cut the garter, and as the sword
was slowly sheathed the spell assumed its ancient power, and they all
gradually sank to rest; but not before the monarch had lifted up his
eyes and hands and exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">The phrase which heads this chapter is a favourite one
in France. It may have had a euphemistic origin, for the giants dreaded
by primitive Europeans were too formidable to be lightly spoken of. But
within most of the period concerning which we have definite knowledge
such phrases would more generally have expressed the half-contemptuous
pity with which these huge beings with weak intellects were regarded.
The Devil imported with Christianity was made over, as we have seen,
into the image of the Dummeteufel, or stupid good-natured giant, and he
is represented in many legends which show him giving his gifts and
services for payments of which he is constantly cheated. Le Bon Diable
in France is somewhat of this character, and is often taken as the sign
of tradesmen who wish to represent themselves as lavishing their goods
recklessly for inadequate compensation. But the large accession of
demons and devils from the East <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb382"
href="#v2pb382" name="v2pb382">382</a>]</span>through Jewish and Moslem
channels, of a character far from stupid, gave a new sense to that
phrase and corresponding ones. There is no doubt that a very distinct
reaction in favour of the Devil arose in Europe, and one expressive of
very interesting facts and forces. The pleasant names given him by the
masses would alone indicate this,&mdash;Monsieur De Scelestat, Lord
Voland, Bl&uuml;mlin (floweret), Federspiel (gay-plumed), Maitre
Bernard, Maitre Parsin (Parisian).</p>
<p><i>The Devil is not so black as he&rsquo;s painted.</i> This proverb

reveal itself. The most orthodox supporters of divine cruelty in their
own theology will cry out against it in another. The saint who is quite
satisfied that the everlasting torture of Satan or Judas is justice,
will look upon the doom of Prometheus as a sign of heathen
heartlessness; and the burning of one widow for a few moments on her
husband&rsquo;s pyre will stimulate merciful missionary ardour among
millions of christians <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb383" href=
"#v2pb383" name="v2pb383">383</a>]</span>whose creed passes the same
poor victim to endless torture, and half the human race with her.</p>
<p>It is doubtful whether the general theological conception of the
functions of Satan is consistent with the belief that he is in a state
of suffering. As an agent of divine punishment he is a part of the
divine government; and it is even probable that had it not been for the
necessity of keeping up his office, theology itself would have found
some means of releasing him and his subordinates from hell, and
ultimately of restoring them to heaven and virtue.<a class="noteref"

<p>It is a legend of the island Iona that when St. Columba attempted to
build a church there, the Devil&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the same Druid
magicians who tried to prevent his landing there by
tempests&mdash;threw down the stones as often as they were piled up. An
oracle declared that the church could arise only after some holy man
had been buried alive at the spot, and the saint&rsquo;s friend Orain
offered himself for the purpose. After Orain had been buried, and the
wall was rising securely, St. Columba was seized with a strong desire
to look upon the face of his poor friend once more. The wall was pulled
down, the body dug up; but instead of Orain being found dead, he sat up
and told <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb384" href="#v2pb384" name=
"v2pb384">384</a>]</span>the assembled christians around him that he
had been to the other world, and discovered that they were in error
about various things,&mdash;especially about Hell, which really did not
exist at all. Outraged by this heresy the christians immediately
covered up Orain again in good earnest.</p>
<p>The resurrection of this primitive universalist of the seventh
century, and his burial again, may be regarded as typifying a dream of
the ultimate restoration of the universe to the divine sway which has
often given signs of life through christian history, though many times
buried. The germ of it is even in Paul&rsquo;s hope that at last
&lsquo;God may be all in all&rsquo; (1 Cor. xv. 28). In Luke x. 17,
also, it was related that the seventy whom Jesus had sent out among the
idol-worshipping Gentiles &lsquo;returned again with joy, saying, Lord,
even the devils are subject unto us through thy name.&rsquo; These
ideas are recalled in various legends, such as that elsewhere related
of the Satyr who came to St. Anthony to ask his prayers for the
salvation of his demonic tribe. On the strength of Anthony&rsquo;s
courteous treatment of that Satyr, the famous Consulteur of the
Inquisition, Father Sinistrari (seventeenth century), rested much of
his argument that demons were included in the atonement wrought by
Christ and might attain final beatitude. The Father affirmed that this
was implied in Christ&rsquo;s words, &lsquo;Other sheep I have which
are not of this flock: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my
voice; and there shall be one fold and one shepherd&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e14235src" href="#xd20e14235" name=
"xd20e14235src">2</a> (John x. 16). That these words were generally
supposed to refer to the inclusion of the Gentile world was not
accepted by Sinistrari as impairing his argument, but the contrary. He
maintained with great ingenuity that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb385" href="#v2pb385" name="v2pb385">385</a>]</span>salvation of
the Gentiles logically includes the salvation of their inspiring
demons, and that there would not be one fold if these aerial beings,
whose existence all authorities attested, were excluded. He even
intimates, though more timidly, that their father, Satan himself, as a
participator in the sin of Adam and sharer of his curse, may be
included in the general provision of the deity for the entire and
absolute removal of the curse throughout nature.</p>
<p>Sinistrari&rsquo;s book was placed on the &lsquo;<span lang=
"la">Index Expurgatorius</span>&rsquo; at Rome in 1709,
&lsquo;<span lang="la">donec corrigatur</span>,&rsquo; eight years
after the author&rsquo;s death; it was republished, &lsquo;<span lang=
"la">correctus</span>,&rsquo; 1753. But the fact that such sentiments
had occupied many devout minds in the Church, and that they had reached
the dignity of a consistent and scholarly statement in theology, was
proved. The opinion grew out of deeper roots than New Testament phrases
or the Anthony fables. The Church had been for ages engaged in the vast
task of converting the Gentile world; in the course of that task it had
succeeded only by successive surrenders of the impossible principles
with which it had started. The Prince of this World had been baptized
afresh with every European throne ascended by the Church. Asmodeus had
triumphed in the sacramental inclusion of marriage; St. Francis
d&rsquo;Assisi, preaching to the animals, represented innumerable pious
myths which had been impossible under the old belief in a universal
curse resting upon nature. The evolution of this tendency may be traced
through the entire history of the Church in such sects as the
Paulicians, Cathari, Bogomiles, and others, who, though they again and
again formulated anew the principle of an eternal Dualism, as often
revealed some further stage in the progressive advance of the
christianised mind towards a normal relation with nature. Thus the
Cathari maintained that only those <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb386" href="#v2pb386" name="v2pb386">386</a>]</span>beings who were
created by the evil principle would remain unrecovered; those who were
created by God, but seduced by the Adversary, would be saved after
sufficient expiation. The fallen angels, they believed, were passing
through earthly, in some cases animal, bodies to the true Church and to
heaven. Such views as these were not those of the learned, but of the
dissenting sects, and they prepared ignorant minds in many countries
for that revival of confidence in their banished deities which made the
cult of Witchcraft.</p>
<p>St. Thomas Aquinas, the &lsquo;Angelical Doctor,&rsquo; in his
famous work &lsquo;<span lang="la">Summa Theologi&aelig;</span>,&rsquo;
maintains that in the Resurrection the bodies of the redeemed will rise
with all their senses and organs, including those of sex, active and
refined. The authentic affirmation of that doctrine in the thirteenth
century was of a significance far beyond the comprehension of the
Church. Aquinas confused the lines between flesh and spirit, especially
by admitting sex into heaven. The Devil could not be far behind. The
true interpretation of his doctrine is to be found in the legend that
Aquinas passed a night in prayer for the salvation and restoration of
the Devil. This legend is the subject of a modern poem so fraught with
the spirit of the medi&aelig;val heart, pining in its dogmatic prison,
that I cannot forbear quoting it here:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">While this might be the feeling of devout philosophers
whose minds were beginning to form a conception of a Cosmos in which
the idea of a perpetual empire of Evil could find no place, the humble
and oppressed masses, as we have seen in the chapter on Witchcraft,
were familiarising their minds with the powers and glories of a Satan
in antagonism to the deities and saints of the Church. It was not a
penitent devil supplicating for pardon whom they desired, but the
veritable Prince of the World, to whom as well as to themselves their
Christian oppressors were odious. They invested the Powers which the
priests pronounced infernal with those humanly just and genial
qualities that had been discarded by ecclesiastical ambition. The
legends which must be interpreted in this sense are very numerous, and
a few of the most characteristic must suffice us here. The habit of
attributing every mishap to the Devil was rebuked in many legends. One
of these related that when a party were driving over a rough road the
waggon broke down and one of the company exclaimed, &lsquo;This is a
bit of the Devil&rsquo;s work!&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb389" href="#v2pb389" name="v2pb389">389</a>]</span>A gentleman
present said, &lsquo;It is a bit of corporation work. I don&rsquo;t
believe in saddling the Devil with all the bad roads and bad
axles.&rsquo; Some time after, when this second speaker was riding over
the same road alone, an old gentleman in black met him, and having
thanked him for his defence of the Devil, presented him with a casket
of splendid jewels. Very numerous are legends of the Devil&rsquo;s
apparition to assist poor architects and mechanics unable to complete
their contracts, even carving beautiful church pillars and the like for
them, and this sometimes without receiving any recompense. The
Devil&rsquo;s apparition in defence of accused innocence is a
well-known feature of European folklore. On one occasion a soldier,
having stopped at a certain inn, confided to the innkeeper some money
he had for safe-keeping, and when he was about to leave the innkeeper
denied having received the deposit. The soldier battered down the door,
and the neighbours of the innkeeper, a prominent man in the town, put
him in prison, where he lay in prospect of suffering death for an
attempted burglary. The poor soldier, being a stranger without means,
was unable to obtain counsel to defend him. When the parties appeared
before the magistrate, a smart young lawyer, with blue hat and white
feathers, unknown in the town, volunteered to defend the soldier, and
related the whole story with such effect that the innkeeper in his
excitement cried, &lsquo;Devil take me if I have the money!&rsquo;
Instantly the smart lawyer spread his wings, and, seizing the
innkeeper, disappeared with him through the roof of the court-room. The
innkeeper&rsquo;s wife, struck with horror, restored the money. In an
Altmark version of this story the Devil visits the prisoner during the
previous night and asks for his soul as fee, but the soldier refuses,
saying he had rather die. Despite this the Devil intervened. It was an
old-time custom in Denmark for courts to sit with an open <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb390" href="#v2pb390" name=
"v2pb390">390</a>]</span>window, in order that the Devil might more
easily fly away with the perjurer.</p>
<p>Always a democrat, the Devil is said in many stories to have
interfered in favour of the peasant or serf against the noble. On one
occasion he relieved a certain district of all its arrogant and idle
noblemen by gathering them up in a sack and flying away with them; but
unhappily, as he was passing over the town of Friesack, his sack came
in collision with the church steeple, and through the hole so torn a
large number of noble lords fell into the town&mdash;which thence
derived its name&mdash;and there they remained to be patrons of the
steeple and burthens on the people.</p>
<div class="figure xd20e14414width" id="v2fig23"><img src=

<p class="figureHead">Fig. 23.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Wicked
Ale-wife.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The Devil was universally regarded as a Nemesis on all publicans and
ale-wives who adulterated the beer they dealt out to the people, or
gave short measures. At Reetz, in Altmark, the legend of an ale-wife
with whom he flew away is connected with a stone on which they are said
to have rested, and the villagers see thereon prints of the
Devil&rsquo;s hoof and the woman&rsquo;s feet. This was a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb391" href="#v2pb391" name=
"v2pb391">391</a>]</span>favourite theme of old English legends. The
accompanying Figure (<a href="#v2fig23">23</a>), one of the misereres
in Ludlow parish church, Shropshire, represents the end of a wicked
ale-wife. A devil on one side reads the long list of her shortcomings,
and on the other side hell-mouth is receiving other sinners. A devil
with bagpipe welcomes her arrival. She carries with her only her
fraudulent measure and the fashionable head-dress paid for out of its
wicked gains.</p>
<p>In a marionette performance which I witnessed at Tours, the
accusations brought against the tradesmen who cheated the people were
such as to make one wish that the services of some equally strict devil
could be secured by the authorities of all cities, to detect
adulterators and dealers in false weights and measures. The same
retributive agency, in the popular interest, was ascribed to the Devil
in his attitude towards misers. There being no law which could reach
men whose hoarded wealth brought no good to themselves or others, such
were deemed proper cases for the interposition of the Devil. There is a
significant contrast between the legends favoured by the Church and
those of popular origin. The former, made prominent in frescoes, often
show how, at the weighing of souls, the sinner is saved by a saint or
angel, or by some instance of service to the Church being placed in the
scale against the otherwise heavier record of evil deeds. A
characteristic legend is that which is the subject of the frescoes in
the portico of St. Lorenzo Church at Rome (thirteenth century). St.
Lawrence sees four devils passing his hermitage, and learns from them
that they are going for the soul of Henry II. In the next scene, when
the wicked Count is weighed, the scroll of his evil deeds far outweighs
that of his good actions, until the Saint casts into the scale a
chalice which the prince had once given to his church. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb392" href="#v2pb392" name=
"v2pb392">392</a>]</span>For that one act Henry&rsquo;s soul ascends to
paradise amid the mortification of the Devils. Though Charles Martel
saved Europe from Saracen sway, he once utilised episcopal revenues for
relief of the state; consequently a synod declares him damned, a saint
sees him in hell, a sulphurous dragon issues from his grave. On the
other hand, the popular idea of the fate of distinguished sinners may
be found hid under misereres, where kings sometimes appear in Hell, and
in the early picture-books which contained a half-christianised
folklore.</p>
<p>It has been observed that the early nature-deities, reflecting the
evil and good of nature, in part through the progress of human thought
and ideality, and through new ethnical rivalries, were degraded into
demons. They then represented the pains, obstructions, and fears in
nature. We have seen that as these apparent external evils were
vanquished or better understood, the demons passed to the inward
nature, and represented a new series of pains, obstructions, and fears.
But these, too, were in part vanquished, or better understood. Still
more, they so changed their forms that the ancient demons-turned-devils
were no longer sufficiently expressive to represent them. Thus we find
that the Jews, mohammedans, and christians did not find their several
special antagonists impressively represented by either Satan, Iblis, or
Beelzebub. Each, therefore, personified its foe in accordance with
later experiences&mdash;an Opponent called Armillus, Aldajjail,
Antichrist (all meaning the same thing), in whom all other devils were
merged.</p>
<p>As to their spirit; but as to their forms they shrank in size and
importance, and did duty in small ways. We have seen how great dragons
were engaged in frightening boys who fished on Sundays, or oppressive
squires; how Satan presided over wine-casks, or was adapted to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb393" href="#v2pb393" name=
"v2pb393">393</a>]</span>punishment of profanity; how hosts of once
tremendous fiends turned into the grotesque little forms which Callot,
truly copying the popular notions around him, painted as motley imps
disturbing monks at their prayers. Such diminutions of the devils
correspond to a parallel process among the gods and goddesses, by which
they were changed to &lsquo;little people&rsquo; or fairies. In both
cases the transformation is an expression of popular disbelief in their
reality.</p>
<p>But revivals took place. The fact of evil is permanent; and whenever
the old chains of fear, after long rusting, finally break, there
follows an insurrection against the social and moral order which alarms
the learned and the pious. These see again the instigations of evil
powers, and it takes form in the imagination of a Dante, a Luther, a
Milton. But when these new portraits of the Devil are painted, it is
with so much contemporary colouring that they do not answer to the
traditional devils preserved in folklore. Dante&rsquo;s Worm does not
resemble the serpent of fable, nor does Milton&rsquo;s Satan answer to
the feathered clown of Miracle Plays. Thus, behind the actual evils
which beset any time, there stands an array of grand diabolical names,
detached from present perils, on which the popular fancy may work
without really involving any theory of Absolute Evil at all. Were
starry Lucifer to be restored to his heavenly sphere, he would be one
great brand plucked from the burning, but the burning might still go
on. Theology itself had filled the world with other devils by
diabolising all the gods and goddesses of rival religions, and the
compassionate heart was thus left free to select such forms or fair
names as preserved some remnant of ancient majesty around them, or some
ray from their once divine halo, and pray or hope for their pardon and
salvation. Fallen foes, no longer able to harm, can hardly fail to
awaken pity and clemency. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb394" href=
"#v2pb394" name="v2pb394">394</a>]</span></p>
<p>With the picture of Dives and Lazarus presented elsewhere (<a href=
"#v1pb281">vol. i. p. 281</a>) may be instructively compared the
accompanying scene of a rich man&rsquo;s death-bed (<a href=
"#v2fig24">Fig. 24</a>), taken from &lsquo;Ars Moriendi,&rsquo; one of
the early block-books. This picture is very remarkable from the
suggestion it contains of an opposition between a devil on the dying
man&rsquo;s right and the hideous dragon on his left. While the dragon
holds up a scroll, bidding him think of his treasure (<i>Yntende
thesauro</i>), the Devil suggests provision for his friends (<i lang=
"la">Provideas amicis</i>). This devil seems to be a representative of
the rich man&rsquo;s relatives who stand near, and appears to be
supported by his ugly superior, who points towards hell as the penalty
of not making such provision as is suggested. There would appear to be
in this picture a vague distinction between the mere bestial fiend who
tempts, and the ugly but good-natured devil who punishes, and whom rich
sinners cannot escape by bequests to churches.</p>

</div>
<p>One of the most notable signs of the appearance of &lsquo;the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb395" href="#v2pb395" name=
"v2pb395">395</a>]</span>good Devil&rsquo; was the universal belief
that he invariably stuck to his word. In all European folklore there is
no instance of his having broken a promise. In this respect his
reputation stands far higher than that of the christians, seeing that
it was a boast of the saints that, following the example of their
godhead, who outwitted Satan in the bargain for man&rsquo;s redemption,
they were continually cheating the Devil by technical quibbles. There
is a significant saying found among Prussian and Danish peasants, that
you may obtain a thing by calling on Jesus, but if you would be sure of
it you must call on the Devil! The two parties were judged by their
representatives.</p>
<p>One of the earliest legendary compacts with the Devil was that made
by St. Theophilus in the sixth century; when he became alarmed and
penitent, the Virgin Mary managed to trick Satan out of the fatal bond.
The &lsquo;Golden Legend&rsquo; of Jacobus de Voragine tells why Satan
was under the necessity of demanding in every case a bond signed with
blood. &lsquo;The christians,&rsquo; said Satan, &lsquo;are cheats;
they make all sorts of promises so long as they want me, and then leave
me in the lurch, and reconcile themselves with Christ so soon as, by my
help, they have got what they want.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Even apart from the consideration of possessing the soul, the
ancient office of Satan as legal prosecutor of souls transmitted, to
the latest forms into which he was modified, this character for
justice. Many medi&aelig;val stories report his gratitude whenever he
is treated with justice, though some of these are disguised by
connection with other demonic forms. Such is the case with the
following romance concerning Charlemagne.</p>
<p>When Charlemagne dwelt at Zurich, in the house commonly called
&lsquo;<span lang="de">Zum Loch</span>,&rsquo; he had a column erected
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb396" href="#v2pb396" name=
"v2pb396">396</a>]</span>which a bell was attached by a rope. Any one
that demanded justice could ring this bell when the king was at his
meals. It happened one day that the bell sounded, but when the servants
went to look no one was there. It continued ringing, so the Emperor
commanded them to go again and find out the cause. They now remarked
that an enormous serpent approached the rope and pulled it. Terrified,
they brought the news to the Emperor, who immediately rose in order to
administer justice to beast as well as man. After the reptile had
respectfully inclined before the emperor, it led him to the banks of
the river and showed him, sitting upon its nest and eggs, an enormous
toad. Charlemagne having examined the case decided thus:&mdash;The toad
was condemned to be burnt and justice shown to the serpent. The verdict
was no sooner given than it was accomplished. A few days after the
snake returned to court, bowed low to the King, crept upon the table,
took the cover from a gold goblet standing there, dropped into it a
precious stone, bowed again and crept away. On the spot where the
serpent&rsquo;s nest had been, Charlemagne built a church called
&lsquo;<span lang="de">Wasserkelch</span>.&rsquo; The stone he gave to
his much-loved spouse. This stone possessed the power of making the
owner especially loved by the Emperor, so that when absent from his
queen he mourned and longed for her. She, well aware that if it came
into other hands the Emperor would soon forget her, put it under her
tongue in the hour of death. The queen was buried with the stone, but
Charlemagne could not separate himself from the body, so had it
exhumed, and for eighteen years carried it about with him wherever he
went. In the meantime, a courtier who had heard of the secret virtue of
the stone, searched the corpse, and at last found the stone hidden
under the tongue, and took it away and concealed it on his own person.
Immediately <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb397" href="#v2pb397"
name="v2pb397">397</a>]</span>the Emperor&rsquo;s love for his wife
turned to the courtier, whom he now scarcely permitted out of his
sight. At Cologne the courtier in a fit of anger threw the stone into a
hot spring, and since then no one has succeeded in finding it. The love
the Emperor had for the knight ceased, but he felt himself wonderfully
attracted to the place where the stone lay hidden. On this spot he
founded Aix-la-Chapelle, his subsequent favourite place of
residence.</p>
<p>It is not wonderful that the tradition should arise at Aix, founded
by the human hero of this romance, that the plan of its cathedral was
supplied by the Devil; but it is characteristic there should be
associated with this legend an example of how he who as a serpent was
awarded justice by Charlemagne was cheated by the priests of Aix. The
Devil gave the design on condition that he was to have the first who
entered the completed cathedral, and a wolf was goaded into the
structure in fulfilment of the contract!</p>
<p>In the ancient myth and romaunt of &lsquo;Merlin&rsquo; may be found
the medi&aelig;val witness to the diabolised religion of Britain. The
emasculated saints of the South-east could not satisfy the vigorous
race in the North-west, and when its gods were outlawed as devils they
brought the chief of them back, as it were, had him duly baptized and
set about his old work in the form of Merlin! Here, side by side with
the ascetic Jesus, brought by Gatien and Augustin, was a Northern
Christ, son of an Arch-incubus, born of a Virgin, baptized in the
shrunken Jordan of a font, performing miracles, summoning dragons to
his aid, overcoming Death and Hell in his way, brought before his
Pilate but confounding him, throning and dethroning kings, and leading
forth, on the Day of Pentecost, an army whose knights are inspired by
Guenever&rsquo;s kisses in place of flaming tongues. How Merlin
&lsquo;went about doing good,&rsquo; after <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb398" href="#v2pb398" name=

he saved the life of his unwedded mother by proving that her child
(himself) was begotten by a devil without her knowledge; how, as a
child, he exposed at once the pretension of the magistrate to high
birth and the laxity of his lady and his parson; how he humiliated the
priestly astrologers of Vortigern, and prophesied the destruction of
that usurper just as it came to pass; how he served Uther during his
seven years&rsquo; reign, and by enabling him to assume the shape of
the Duke of Cornwall and so enjoy the embraces of the Duchess Igerna,
secured the birth of Arthur and hope of the Sangr&eacute;al;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e14488src" href="#xd20e14488" name=

birth and assisted him in causing illegitimate births; and how at last
he was bound by his own spells, wielded by Vivien, in a prison of air
where he now remains;&mdash;this was the great medi&aelig;val gospel of
a baptized christian Antichrist which superseded the imported kingdom
not of this world.</p>

<p>Merlin was the Good Devil, but baptism was a fatal Vivien-spell to
him. He still dwells in all the air which is breathed by Anglo-Saxon
men,&mdash;an ever-expanding prison! Whether the Briton is transplanted
in America, India, or Africa, he still carries with him the Sermon on
the Mount as inspired by his baptized Prince of the Air, and his gospel
of the day is, &lsquo;If thine enemy hunger, starve him; if he thirst,
give him fire; if he hate you, heap melted lead on his head!&rsquo;
Such remains the soul of the greatest race, under the fatal spell of a
creed that its barbarism needs only baptism to be made holiness and
virtue. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb399" href="#v2pb399" name=

<p>In the reign of George II., when Lord Bute and a Princess of easy
virtue were preying on England, and fanatical preachers were directing
their donkeys to heaven beside the conflagration of John Bull&rsquo;s
house, the eye of Hogarth at least (as is shown in our Figure 25, from
his &lsquo;Raree Show&rsquo;) was able to see what the baptized Merlin
had become in his realm of Air. The other worldly-Devil is
serpent-legged Hypocrisy. The Nineteenth Century has replaced Merlin by
Mephistopheles, the Devil who, despite a cloven foot, steps firmly on
earth, and means the power that wit and culture can bring against the
baptized giant Force. Him the gods fear not, even look upon with
satisfaction. In the &lsquo;Prologue in Heaven,&rsquo; of
Goethe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Faust,&rsquo; the Lord is even more gracious to
Mephistopheles than the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb400" href=

<p class="first">This is but a more modern expression of the rabbinical
fable, already noted, that when the first man was formed there were
beside him two Spirits,&mdash;one on the right that remained quiescent,
another on the left who ever moved restlessly up and down. When the
first sin was committed, he of the left was changed to a devil. But he
still meant the progressive, inquiring nature of man. &lsquo;The Spirit
I, that evermore denies,&rsquo; says the Mephistopheles of Goethe. How
shall man learn truth if he know not the Spirit that denies? How shall
he advance if he know not the Spirit of discontent? This restless
spirit gains through his ignorance a cloven hoof,&mdash;a divided
movement, sometimes right, sometimes wrong. From his selfishness it
acquires a double tongue. But both hoof and serpent-tongue are beneath
the evolutional power of experience; they shall be humanised to the
foot that marches firmly on earth, and the tongue that speaks truth;
and, the baptismal spell broken, Merlin shall descend, bringing to
man&rsquo;s aid all his sharp-eyed dragons transformed to beautiful

the pre-petrified era of Theology this hope appears to have visited the
minds of some, Origen for instance. But by many centuries of
utilisation the Devil became so essential to the throne of Christianity
that theologians were more ready to spare God from their system than
Satan. &lsquo;Even the clever Madame de Sta&euml;l,&rsquo; said Goethe,
&lsquo;was greatly scandalised that I kept the Devil in such
good-humour. In the presence of God the Father, she insisted upon it,
he ought to be more grim and spiteful. What will she say if she sees
him promoted a step higher,&mdash;nay, perhaps, meets him in
heaven?&rsquo; Though, in another conversation with Falk, Goethe
intimates that he had written a passage &lsquo;where the Devil himself
receives grace and mercy from God,&rsquo; the artistic theory of his
poem could permit no nearer approach to this than those closing lines
(Faust, II.) in which Mephistopheles reproaches the
&lsquo;case-hardened Devil&rsquo; and himself for their mismanagement.

<p class="first">&lsquo;The christians,&rsquo; said Celsus,
&lsquo;dream of some antagonist to God&mdash;a devil, whom they call
Satanas, who thwarted God when he wished to benefit mankind. The Son of
God suffered death from Satanas, but they tell us we are to defy him,
and to bear the worst he can do; Satanas will come again and work
miracles, and pretend to be God, but we are not to believe him. The
Greeks tell of a war among the gods; army against army, one led by
Saturn, and one by Ophincus; of challenges and battles; the vanquished
falling into the ocean, the victors reigning in heaven. In the
Mysteries we have the rebellion of the Titans, and the fables of
Typhon, and Horus, and Osiris. The story of the Devil plotting against
man is stranger than either of these. The Son of God is injured by the
Devil, and charges us to fight against him at our peril. Why not punish
the Devil instead of threatening poor wretches whom he
deceives?&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e14529src" href=
"#xd20e14529" name="xd20e14529src">1</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>The christians comprehended as little as their critic that story
they brought, stranger than all the legends of besieged deities, of a
Devil plotting against man. Yet a little historic perspective makes the
situation simple: the gods had taken refuge in man, therefore the
attack was transferred to man.</p>
<p>Priestly legends might describe the gods as victorious over the
Titans, the wild forces of nature, but the people, to their sorrow,
knew better; the priests, in dealing with the people, showed that they
also knew the victory to be on the other side. A careful writer
remarks:&mdash;&lsquo;When these (Greek) divinities are in any case
appealed to with unusual seriousness, their nature-character
reappears.... When Poseidon hesitates to defer to the positive commands
of Zeus (Il. xix. 259), Iris reminds him that there are the Erinnyes to
be reckoned with (Il. xv. 204), and he gives in at once.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e14537src" href="#xd20e14537" name=
"xd20e14537src">2</a> The Erinnyes represent the steady supremacy of
the laws and forces of nature over all personifications of them. Under
uniform experience man had come to recognise his own moral autocracy in
his world. He looked for incarnations, and it was a hope born of an
atheistic view of external nature. This was the case not only with the
evolution of Greek religion, but in that of every religion.</p>
<p>When man&rsquo;s hope was thus turned to rest upon man, he found
that all the Titans had followed him. Ophincus (Ophion) had passed
through Ophiomorphus to be a Man of Sin; and this not in one, but by
corresponding forms in every line of religious development. The
ferocities of outward nature appeared with all their force in man, and
renewed their power with the fine armoury of his intelligence. He must
here contend with tempests of passion, stony selfishness, and the whole
animal creation nestling <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb403" href=
"#v2pb403" name="v2pb403">403</a>]</span>in heart and brain, prowling
still, though on two feet. The theory of evolution is hardly a century
old as science, but it is an ancient doctrine of Religion. The fables
of Pilpay and &AElig;sop represent an early recognition of
&lsquo;survivals.&rsquo; Recurrence to original types was recognised as
a mystical phenomenon in legends of the bandit turned wolf, and other
transformations. One of the oldest doctrines of Eschatology is
represented in the accompanying picture (<a href="#v2fig26">Fig.
26</a>), from Thebes, of two dog-headed apes ferrying over to Hades a
gluttonous soul that has been weighed before Osiris, and assigned his
appropriate form.</p>

<p>The devils of Lust are so innumerable that several volumes would be
required to enumerate the legends and superstitions connected with
them. But, fortunately for my reader and myself, these, more than any
other class of phantoms, are very slight modifications of the same
form. The innumerable phallic deities, the incubi and succub&aelig;,
are monotonous as the waves of the ocean, which might fairly typify the
vast, restless, and stormy expanse of sexual nature to which they
belong.</p>
<p>In &lsquo;The Golden Legend&rsquo; there is a pleasant tale of a
gentleman who, having fallen into poverty, went into solitude, and was
there approached by a chevalier in black, mounted on a fine horse. This
knight having inquired the reason of the other&rsquo;s sadness,
promised him that, if he would return home, he would find at a certain
place vast <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb404" href="#v2pb404" name=
"v2pb404">404</a>]</span>sums of gold; but this was on condition that
he should bring his beautiful wife to that solitary spot in exactly a
year&rsquo;s time. The gentleman, having lived in greater splendour
than ever during the year, asked his wife to ride out with him on the
appointed day. She was very pious, and having prayed to the Virgin,
accompanied her husband to the spot. There the gentleman in black met
them, but only to tremble. &lsquo;Perfidious man!&rsquo; he cried,
&lsquo;is it thus you repay my benefits? I asked you to bring your
wife, and you have brought me the Mother of God, who will send me back
to hell!&rsquo; The Devil having vanished, the gentleman fell on his
knees before the Virgin. He returned home to find his wife sleeping
quietly.</p>
<p>Were we to follow this finely-mounted gentleman in black, we should
be carried by no uncertain steps back to those sons of God who took
unto themselves wives of the daughters of men, as told in Genesis; and
if we followed the Virgin, we should, by less certain but yet probable
steps, discover her prototype in Eve before her fall, virginal as she
was meant to remain so far as man was concerned. In the chapters
relating to the Eden myth and its personages, I have fully given my
reasons for believing that the story of Eve, the natural childlessness
of Sarah, and the immaculate conception by Mary, denote, as sea-rocks
sometimes mark the former outline of a coast, a primitive theory of
celibacy in connection with that of a divine or Holy Family. It need
only be added here that this impossible ideal in its practical
development was effectual in restraining the sexual passions of
mankind. Although the reckless proclamation of the wild nature-gods
(Elohim), &lsquo;Be fruitful and multiply,&rsquo; has been accepted by
christian bibliolators as the command of Jehovah, and philanthropists
are even punished for suggesting means of withstanding the effects
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb405" href="#v2pb405" name=
"v2pb405">405</a>]</span>of nuptial licentiousness, yet they are
farther from even the letter of the Bible than those protestant
celibates, the American Shakers, who discard the sexual relation
altogether. The theory of the Shakers that the functions of sex
&lsquo;belong to a state of nature, and are inconsistent with a state
of grace,&rsquo; as one of their members in Ohio stated it to me,
coincides closely with the rabbinical theory that Adam and Eve, by
their sin, fell to the lowest of seven earthly spheres, and thus came
within the influence of the incubi and succub&aelig;, by their union
with whom the world was filled with the demonic races, or Gentiles.</p>
<p>It is probable that the fencing-off of Eden, the founding of the
Abrahamic household and family, and the command against adultery, were
defined against that system of rape&mdash;or marriage by
capture&mdash;which prevailed among the &lsquo;sons of Elohim,&rsquo;
who saw the &lsquo;daughters of men that they were fair,&rsquo; and
followed the law of their eyes. The older rabbins were careful to
preserve the distinction between the <i>Bene Elohim</i> and the
<i>Ischim</i>, and it ultimately amounted to that between Jews and
Gentiles.</p>
<p>The suspicion of a devil lurking behind female beauty thus begins.
The devils love beauty, and the beauties love admiration. These are
perils in the constitution of the family. But there are other legends
which report the frequency with which woman was an unwilling victim of
the lustful Anakim or other powerful lords. Throughout the world are
found legends of beautiful virgins sacrificed to powerful demons or
deities. These are sometimes so realistic as to suggest the possibility
that the fair captives of savage chieftains may indeed have been
sometimes victims of their Ogre&rsquo;s voracity as well as his lust.
At any rate, cruelty and lust are nearly related. The Blue Beard myth
opens out horrible possibilities. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>One of the best-known legends in Japan is that concerning the fiend
Shudendozi, who derives his name from the two characteristics of
possessing the face of a child and being a heavy drinker. The
child-face is so emphasised in the stories that one may suspect either
that his fair victims were enticed to his stronghold by his air of
innocence, or else that there is some hint as to maternal longings in
the fable.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the eleventh century, when Ichijo II. was
Emperor, lived the hero Yorimitsa. In those days the people of Kiyoto
were troubled by an evil spirit which abode near the Rasho Gate. One
night, when merry with his companions, Ichijo said, &lsquo;Who dare go
and defy the demon of the Rasho Gate, and set up a token that he has
been there?&rsquo; &lsquo;That dare I,&rsquo; answered Tsuma, who,
having donned his mail, rode out in the bleak night to the Rasho Gate.
Having written his name on the gate, returning, his horse shivers with
fear, and a huge hand coming out of the gate seized the knight&rsquo;s
helmet. He struggled in vain. He then cuts off the demon&rsquo;s arm,
and the demon flies howling. Tsuma takes the demon&rsquo;s arm home,
and locks it in a box. One night the demon, having the shape of
Tsuma&rsquo;s aunt, came and said, &lsquo;I pray you show me the arm of
the fiend.&rsquo; &lsquo;I will show it to no man, and yet to thee will
I show it,&rsquo; replied he. When the box is opened a black cloud
enshrouds the aunt, and the demon disappears with the arm. Thereafter
he is more troublesome than ever. The demon carried off the fairest
virgins of Kiyoto, ravished and ate them, no beauty being left in the
city. The Emperor commands Yorimitsa to destroy him. The hero, with
four trusty knights and a great captain, went to the hidden places of
the mountains. They fell in with an old man, who invited them into his
dwelling, and gave them wine to drink; and when they were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb407" href="#v2pb407" name=
"v2pb407">407</a>]</span>going he presented them with wine. This old
man was a mountain-god. As they proceeded they met a beautiful lady
washing blood from garments in a valley, weeping bitterly. In reply to
their inquiries she said the demon had carried her off and kept her to
wash his clothes, meaning when weary of her to eat her. &lsquo;I pray
your lordships to help me!&rsquo; The six heroes bid her lead them to
the ogre&rsquo;s cave. One hundred devils mounted guard before it. The
woman first went in and told him they had come. The ogre called them
in, meaning to eat them. Then they saw Shudendozi, a monster with the
face of a little child. They offered him wine, which flew to his head:
he becomes merry and sleeps, and his head is cut off. The head leaps up
and tries to bite Yorimitsa, but he had on two helmets. When all the
devils are slain, he brings the head of Shudendozi to the Emperor. In a
similar story of the same country the lustful ogre by no means
possesses <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb408" href="#v2pb408" name=
"v2pb408">408</a>]</span>Shudendozi&rsquo;s winning visage, as may be
seen by the popular representation of him (<a href="#v2fig27">Fig.
27</a>), with a knight&rsquo;s hand grasping his throat.</p>
<p>A Singhalese demon of like class is Bahirawa, who takes his name
from the hill of the same name, towering over Kandy, in which he is
supposed to reside. The legend runs that the astrologers told a king
whose queen was afflicted by successive miscarriages, that she would
never be delivered of a healthy child unless a virgin was sacrificed
annually on the top of this hill. This being done, several children
were borne to him. When his queen was advanced in years the king
discontinued this observance, and consequently many diseases fell upon
the royal family and the city, after which the annual sacrifice was
resumed, and continued until 1815, when the English occupied Kandy. The
method of the sacrifice was to bind a young girl to a stake on the top
of the hill with jungle-creepers. Beside her, on an altar, were placed
boiled rice and flowers; incantations were uttered, and the girl left,
to be generally found dead of fright in the morning. An old woman, who
in early years had undergone this ordeal, survived, and her safety no
doubt co-operated with English authority to diminish the popular fear
of Bahirawa, but still few natives would be found courageous enough to
ascend the hill at night.</p>
<p>One of the lustful demons of Ceylon is Calu Cumara, that is, the
Black Prince. He is supposed to have seven different
apparitions,&mdash;prince of fire, of flowers, of groves, of graves, of
eye-ointments, of the smooth body, and of sexuality. The Saga says he
was a Buddhist priest, who by exceeding asceticism and accumulated
merits had gained the power to fly, but passion for a beautiful woman
caused him to fall. By disappointment in the love for which he had
parted with so much his heart was broken, and he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb409" href="#v2pb409" name=
"v2pb409">409</a>]</span>became a demon. In this condition he is for
ever tortured by the passion of lustful desire, the only satisfaction
of which he can obtain being to afflict young and fair women with
illness. He is a very dainty demon, and can be soothed if great care is
taken in the offerings made to him, which consist of rice of finest
quality, plantains, sugar-cane, oranges, cocoa-nuts, and cakes. He is
of dark-blue complexion and his raiment black.</p>
<p>In Singhalese demonolatry there are seven female demons of lust,
popularly called the Madana Yaksenyo. These sisters are&mdash;Cama
(lust); Cini (fire); Mohanee (ignorance); Rutti (pleasure); Cala
(maturity); Mal (flowers); Puspa (perfumes). They are the abettors of
seduction, and are invoked in the preparation of philtres.<a class=

<p class="first">Many traditions preceded this ungallant creed, some of
which have been referred to in our chapters on Lilith and Eve.
Corresponding to these are the stories related by Herodotus of the
overthrow of the kingdom of the Heraclid&aelig; and freedom of the
Greeks, through the revenge of the Queen, &lsquo;the most beautiful of
women,&rsquo; upon her husband Candaules for having contrived that
Gyges <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb410" href="#v2pb410" name=

Greeks of Pontus also ascribed the origin of the Scythian race, the
scourge of all nations, to a serpent-woman, who, having stolen away the
mares which Herakles had captured from Gergon, refused to restore them
except on condition of having children by him. From the union of
Herakles with this &lsquo;half virgin, half viper,&rsquo; sprang three
sons, of whom the youngest was Scythes.</p>

</div>
<p>Not only are feminine seductiveness and liability to seduction
represented in the legends of female demons and devils, but quite as
much the jealousy of that sex. If the former were weaknesses which
might overthrow kingdoms, the latter was a species of animalism which
could devastate the home and society. Although jealousy is sometimes
regarded as venial, if not indeed a sign of true love, it is an outcome
of the animal nature. The Japanese have shown a true observation of
nature in portraying their female Oni (devil) of jealousy (<a href=
"#v2fig28">Fig. 28</a>) with sharp erect horns and bristling hair. The
raising &lsquo;of the ornamental <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb411"
href="#v2pb411" name="v2pb411">411</a>]</span>plumes by many birds
during their courtship,&rsquo; mentioned by Mr. Darwin, is the more
pleasing aspect of that emotion which, blending with fear and rage,
puffs out the lizard&rsquo;s throat, ruffles the cock&rsquo;s neck, and
raises the hair of the insane.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e14651src"
href="#xd20e14651" name="xd20e14651src">7</a></p>
<p>An ancient legend mingles jealousy with the myth of Eden at every
step. Rabbi Jarchi says that the serpent was jealous of Adam&rsquo;s
connubial felicity, and a passage in Josephus shows that this was an
ancient opinion. The jealousy of Adam&rsquo;s second wife felt by his
first (Lilith) was by many said to be the cause of her conspiracy with
the serpent. The most beautiful medi&aelig;val picture of her that I
have seen was in an illuminated Bible in Strasburg, in which, with all
her wealth of golden hair and her beauty, Lilith holds her mouth, with
a small rosy apple in it, towards Adam. Eve seems to snatch it. Then
there is an old story that when Eve had eaten the apple she saw the
angel of death, and urged Adam to eat the fruit also, in order that he
might not become a widower.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that there should have sprung up a legend that
Satan made his second attack upon the race formed by Jehovah, and his
plan for perpetuating it on earth by means of a flirtation with
Noah&rsquo;s wife, and also by awakening her jealousy. The older legend
concerning Noah&rsquo;s wife is that mentioned by Tabari, which merely
states that she ridiculed the predictions of a deluge by her husband.
So much might have been suggested by the silence of the Bible
concerning her. The Moslem tradition that the Devil managed to get into
the ark is also ancient. He caught hold of the ass&rsquo;s tail just as
it was about to enter. The ass came on slowly, and Noah, becoming
impatient, exclaimed, &lsquo;You cursed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb412" href="#v2pb412" name="v2pb412">412</a>]</span>one, come in
quick!&rsquo; When Noah, seeing the Devil in the ark, asked by what
right he was there, the other said, &lsquo;By your order; you said,
&ldquo;Accursed one, come in;&rdquo; I am the accursed one!&rsquo; This
story, which seems contrived to show that one may not be such an ass as
he looks, was superseded by the legend which represents Satan as having
been brought into the ark concealed under Noria&rsquo;s (or
Noraita&rsquo;s) dress.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Fig. 29.&mdash;<span class="sc">Satan and

</div>
<p>The most remarkable legend of this kind is that found in the Eastern
Church, and which is shown in various medi&aelig;val designs in Russia.
Satan is shown, in an early sixteenth century picture belonging to
Count Uvarof (<a href="#v2fig29">Fig. 29</a>), offering Noah&rsquo;s
wife a bunch of <i>khmel</i> (hops) with which to brew <i>kvas</i> and
make Noah drunk; for the story was that Noah did not tell his wife that
a deluge was coming, knowing that she could not keep a secret. In the
old version of the legend given by Buslaef, &lsquo;after apocryphal
tradition used by heretics,&rsquo; Satan always addresses Noah&rsquo;s
wife as <i>Eve</i>, which indicates a theory. It was meant to be
considered as a second edition of the attack on the divine plan begun
in Eden, and revived in the temptation of Sara. Satan not only taught
this new Eve how to make <i>kvas</i> but also <i>vodka</i> (brandy);
and when he had awakened her jealousy about Noah&rsquo;s frequent
absence, he bade her <span class="corr" id="xd20e14688" title=
"Source: substitue">substitute</span> the brandy for the beer when her
husband, as usual, asked for the latter. When Noah was thus in his cups
she asked him where he went, and why he kept late hours. He revealed
his secret to his Eve, who disclosed it to Satan. The tempter appears
to have seduced her from Noah, and persuaded her to be dilatory when
entering the ark. When all the animals had gone in, and all the rest of
her family, Eve said, &lsquo;I have forgotten my pots and pans,&rsquo;
and went to fetch them; next she said, &lsquo;I have forgotten my
spoons and forks,&rsquo; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb413"
href="#v2pb413" name="v2pb413">413</a>]</span>returned for them. All of
this had been arranged by Satan in order to make Noah curse; and he had
just slipped <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb414" href="#v2pb414"
name="v2pb414">414</a>]</span>under Eve&rsquo;s skirt when he had the
satisfaction of hearing the intended Adam of a baptized world cry to
his wife, &lsquo;Accursed one, come in!&rsquo; Since Jehovah himself
could not prevent the carrying out of a patriarch&rsquo;s curse, Satan
was thus enabled to enter the ark, save himself from being drowned, and
bring mischief into the human world once more.</p>
<p>This is substantially the same legend as that of the medi&aelig;val
Morality called &lsquo;Noah&rsquo;s Ark, or the Shipwright&rsquo;s
Ancient Play or Dirge.&rsquo; The Devil says to Noah&rsquo;s
wife:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Yes, hold thee still le dame,</p>
<p class="line">And I shall tell thee how;</p>
<p class="line">I swear thee by my crooked snout,</p>

<p class="line">Is little to thy profit.</p>

<p class="line">I shall be by thy side.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">There are some intimations in the Slavonic version
which look as if it might have belonged to some Paulician or other
half-gnostic theory that the temptation of Noraita (Eve II.), and her
alienation from her husband, were meant to prevent the repopulation of
the Earth.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e14735src" href="#xd20e14735"

<p>The next attempt of the Devil, as agent of the Elohistic creation,
to ruin the race of man, introduces us to another form of animalism
which has had a large expression in Devil-lore. It is related in
rabbinical mythology that when, as is recorded in Gen. ix. 20, Noah was
planting a vineyard, the Devil (Asmodeus) came and proposed to join him
in the work. This having been agreed to, this evil partner brought in
succession a sheep, a lion, and a hog, and sacrificed them on the spot.
The result was that the wine when drunk first gave the drinker the
quality of a sheep, then that of a lion, and finally that of a
hog.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e14746src" href="#xd20e14746" name=
"xd20e14746src">9</a> It was by this means that Noah was reduced to
swinish inebriation. There followed the curses on those around him,
which, however drunken, were those of a father, and reproduced on the
cleansed world all the dooms which had been pronounced in Eden.</p>
<p>If the date of this legend could be made early enough, it would
appear to be a sort of revenge for this temptation of Noah to
drunkenness that Talmudic fable shows Asmodeus brought under bondage to
Solomon, and forced to work on the Temple, by means of wine. Asmodeus
had dug for himself a well, and planted beside it a tree, so making for
himself a pleasant spot for repose during his goings to and fro on
earth. But Solomon&rsquo;s messenger Benaja managed to cover this with
a tank which he filled with wine. Asmodeus, on his return, repeated to
himself the proverb, &lsquo;Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb416" href="#v2pb416" name=
"v2pb416">416</a>]</span>whosoever is deceived thereby is not
wise&rsquo; (Prov. xx. 1); yet, being very thirsty, he drank, fell
asleep, and when he awoke found himself loaded with chains.</p>
<p>However, after working for a time for Solomon, he discovered that
king&rsquo;s weaknesses and played upon them. Solomon was so puffed up
with a sense of his power that he accepted a challenge from his slave
(Asmodeus) to show his superiority without the assistance of his magic
ring, and without keeping his competitor in bonds. No sooner was
Asmodeus free, and in possession of the ring, than he transported
Solomon four hundred miles away, where he remained for a long time
among the seductive beauties of the Courts of Naamah, Rahab, and other
she-devils. Meanwhile the Devil, assuming the form of Solomon, sat on
his throne, and became the darling of his Queen and concubines.</p>
<p>The Devil of Wine and strong drink generally has a wide
representation in folklore. We find him in the bibulous Serpent of
Japan, who first loses his eight heads metaphorically, and then
literally from the first of Swords-men. The performances of
Mephistopheles in Auerbach&rsquo;s Cellar are commemorated in its old
frescoes, and its motto: &lsquo;Live, drink, carouse, remembering Faust
and his punishment: it came slowly, but was in ample measure.&rsquo;
Thuringian legends relate that the Devil tries to stop the building of
churches by casting down the stones, but this may be stopped by the
builders promising to erect a winehouse in the same neighbourhood. An
old English legend relates that a great man&rsquo;s cellar was haunted
by devils who drank up his wine. On one occasion a barrel was marked
with holy water, and the devil was found stuck fast on it.</p>
<p>Gluttony, both in eating and drinking, has had its many
personifications. The characteristics of the Hunger <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb417" href="#v2pb417" name=
"v2pb417">417</a>]</span>demons are travestied in such devils as these,
only the diabolical, as distinguished from the demonic element, appears
in features of luxuriousness. The contrast between the starveling
saints of the early Church and the well-fed friars of later times was a
frequent subject of caricature, as in the accompanying example
(<a href="#v2fig30">Fig. 30</a>) from the British Museum, fourteenth
century (MS. Arundel), where a lean devil is satisfying himself through
a fattened friar. One of the most significant features of the old
legend of Faust is the persistence of the animal character in which
Mephistopheles appears. He is an ugly dog&mdash;a fit emblem of the
scholar&rsquo;s relapse into the canine temper which flies at the world
as at a bone he means to gnaw. Faust does not like this genuine form,
and bids the Devil change it. Mephistopheles then takes the form of a
Franciscan friar; but &lsquo;the kernel of the brute&rsquo; is in him
still, and he at once loads Faust&rsquo;s table with luxuries and wines
from the cellars of the Archbishop of Salzburg and other rich priests.
The prelates are fond of their bone too. When Mephistopheles and Faust
find their way into the Vatican, it is to witness carousals of the Pope
and his Cardinals. They snatch from them their luxuries and
wine-goblets as they are about to enjoy them. Against these invisible
invaders the holy men bring their crucifixes and other powers of
exorcism; and it is all snarling and growling&mdash;canine priest
against puppy astrologer. Nor was it very different in the history of
the long contention between the two for the big bone of
Christendom.</p>

<p>The lust of Gold had its devils, and they were not different from
other types of animalism. This was especially the case with such as
represented money, extorted from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb418"
href="#v2pb418" name="v2pb418">418</a>]</span>the people to supply
wealth to dissolute princes and prelates. The giants of Antwerp
represent the power of the pagan monarchs who exacted tribute; but
these were replaced by such guardians of tribute-money as the Satyr of
our picture (<a href="#v2fig31">Fig. 31</a>), which Edward the
Confessor saw seated on a barrel of Danegeld,</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Vit un d&eacute;able saer desus</p>
<p class="line">Le tresor, noir et hidus.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">There are many good fables in European folklore with
regard to the miser&rsquo;s gold, and &lsquo;devil&rsquo;s money&rsquo;
generally, which exhibit a fine instinct. A man carries home a package
of such gold, and on opening it there drop out, instead of money, paws
and nails of cats, frogs, and bears&mdash;the latter being an almost
personal allusion to the Exchange. A French miser&rsquo;s money-safe
being opened, two frogs only were found. The Devil could not get any
other soul than the gold, and the cold-blooded reptiles were left as a
sign of the life that had been lived.</p>

<p>In the legends of the swarms of devils which beset St. Anthony we
find them represented as genuine animals. Our Anglo-Saxon fathers,
however, were quite unable to appreciate the severity of the conflict
which man had to wage with the animal world in Southern countries and
in earlier times. Nor had their reverence for nature and its forms been
crushed out by the pessimist theory of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb419" href="#v2pb419" name=
"v2pb419">419</a>]</span>earth maintained by Christianity. Gradually
the representation of the animal tempters was modified, and instead of
real animal forms there were reported the bearded bestialities which
surrounded St. Guthlac and St. Godric. The accompanying picture
(<a href="#v2fig32">Fig. 32</a>) is a group from Breughel (1565),
representing the devils called around St. James by a magician. These
grotesque forms will repay study. If we should make a sketch of the
same kind, only surrounding the saint with the real animal shapes most
nearly resembling these nondescripts, it would cease to be a diabolical
scene.</p>

<p>For beastliness is not a character of beasts; it is the arrest of
man. It is not the picturesque donkey in the meadow that is ridiculous,
but the donkey on two feet; not the bear of zoological gardens that is
offensive morally, but the rough, who cannot always be caged; it is the
two-legged calf, the snake pretending to be a man, the ape in evening
dress, who ever made the problem of evil at all formidable. It was
insoluble until men had discovered as Science that law of Evolution
which the ancient world knew as Ethics.</p>
<p>A Hindu fable relates that the animals, in their migration, came to
an abyss they could not cross, and that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb420" href="#v2pb420" name=
"v2pb420">420</a>]</span>gods made man as a bridge across it. Science
and Reason confirm these ancient instincts of our race. Man is that
bridge stretching between the animal and the ideal habitat by which, if
the development be normal, all the passions pass upward into educated
powers. Any pause or impediment on that bridge brings all the animals
together to rend and tear the man who cannot convey them across the
abyss. A very slight arrest may reveal to a man that he is a vehicle of
intensified animalism. The lust of the goat, the pride of the peacock,
the wrath of the lion, beautiful in their appropriate forms, become, in
the guise of a man uncontrolled by reason, the vices which used to be
called possession, and really are insanities. <span class=

giving of Eve&rsquo;s name to Noah&rsquo;s wife is not the only
significant thing about this Russian tradition and its picture.
Long-bearded devils are nowhere normal except in the representations by
the Eastern Church of the monarch of Hell. By referring to p. 253 of
this volume the reader will observe the influences which caused the
infernal king to be represented as counterpart of the Deity. As this
tradition about Noah&rsquo;s wife is suggestive of a Gnostic origin, it
really looks as if the Devil in it were meant to act the part which the
Gnostics ascribed to Jehovah himself (vol. ii. p. 207). The Devil is
said in rabbinical legends to have seduced the wives of Noah&rsquo;s
sons; this legend seems to show that his aim was to populate the
post-diluvial world entirely with his own progeny, in this being an
Ildabaoth, or degraded edition of Jehovah trying to establish his own
family in the earth by the various means related in vol. i. chap.

<p class="first">I lately heard the story of a pious negro woman whose
faith in hell was sorely tried by a sceptic who asked her how brimstone
enough could be found to burn all the wicked people in the world. After
taking some days for reflection, the old woman, when next challenged by
the sceptic, replied, that she had concluded that &lsquo;every man took
his own brimstone.&rsquo; This humble saint was unconscious that her
instinct had reached the finest thought of Milton, whose Satan says
&lsquo;Myself am hell.&rsquo; Marlowe&rsquo;s Mephistopheles also says,
&lsquo;Where we are is hell.&rsquo; And, far back as the year 633, the
holy man Fursey, who believed himself to have been guided by an angel
near the region of the damned, related a vision much like the view of
the African woman. There were four fires&mdash;Falsehood, Covetousness,
Discord, Injustice&mdash;which joined to form one great flame. When
this drew near, Fursey, in fear, said, &lsquo;Lord, behold the fire
draws near me.&rsquo; The angel answered, &lsquo;That which you did not
kindle shall not burn you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such association of any principle of justice, even in form so crude,
has become rare enough in Christendom to excite applause when it
appears, though the applause has about it that infusion of the
grotesque which one perceives when gallery-gods cheer the actor who
heroically declares that a man ought not to strike a woman. When
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb422" href="#v2pb422" name=
"v2pb422">422</a>]</span>we go back to the atmosphere of Paganism we
find that retribution had among them a real meaning. Nothing can be in
more remarkable contrast than the disorderly characterless hell of
Christendom, into which the murderer and the man who confuses the
Persons of the Godhead alike burn everlastingly in most inappropriate
fires, and the Hades of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, where every punishment
bears relation to the offence, and is limited in duration to the degree
of the offence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Egyptians,&rsquo; says Herodotus (ii. 123), &lsquo;were
the first who asserted that the soul of man is immortal, and that when
the body perishes it enters into some other animal, constantly
springing into existence; and when it has passed through the different
kinds of terrestrial, marine, and aerial beings, it again enters into
the body of a man that is born, and that this revolution is made in
three thousand years.&rsquo; Probably Plato imported from Egypt his
fancy of the return of one dead to relate the scenes of heaven and
hell, Er the Armenian (Republic, x. 614) suggesting an evolution of
Rhampsinitus (Herod. ii. 122), who descended to Hades alive, played
dice with Ceres, and brought back gold. The vision of Er represents a
terrible hell, indeed, but those punished were chiefly murderers and
tyrants. They are punished tenfold for every wrong they had committed.
But when this punishment is ended, each soul must return to the earth
in such animal form as he or she might select. The animals, too, had
their choice. Er saw that the choice was generally determined by the
previous earthly life,&mdash;many becoming animals because of some
spite derived from their experience. &lsquo;And not only did men pass
into animals, but I must also mention that there were animals tame and
wild who changed into one another, and into corresponding human
natures, the good into the gentle, the evil into the savage,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb423" href="#v2pb423" name=
"v2pb423">423</a>]</span>in all sorts of combinations.&rsquo; Sly
Plato! Such is his estimate of what men&rsquo;s selections of their
paradises are worth!</p>
<p>Orpheus chose to be a swan, hating to be born of woman, because
women murdered him; Ajax became a lion and Agamemnon an eagle, because
they had suffered injustice from men; Atalanta would be an athlete, and
the jester Thersites a monkey; and Odysseus went about to find the life
of a private gentleman with nothing to do. If Plutarch&rsquo;s friend
Thespesius had pondered well this irony of Plato, he would hardly have
brought back from his visit to Hades the modification that demons were
provided to assign the animal forms in which souls should be born again
on earth. They could hardly have done for the wicked anything worse
than Plato shows them doing for themselves. But the meaning of Plutarch
is the same. Thespesius sees demons preparing the body of a viper for
Nero to be born into, since it was said the young of that reptile
destroy their mother at birth.</p>

<p>Among the Persians the idea of future rewards and punishments
exceeds the exactness of the Koran&mdash;&lsquo;Whoso hath done an atom
of justice shall behold it, and whoso hath done an atom of injustice
shall behold it.&rsquo; The Persian Sufis will even subdivide the soul
rather than that any good act should go down with the larger gross of
wickedness. S&aacute;di tells of a vision where a man was seen in hell,
all except one foot, which was twined with flowers. With all his
wickedness the man had with that foot shoved a bundle of hay within
reach of a weary ox.</p>
<p>But while Persian poets&mdash;Sufis, ennobling the old name
Sophist&mdash;preserved thus a good deal of the universalism of
Parsaism, a Mohammedanism hard as the Scythians who brought it turned
the heart of the people in that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb424"
href="#v2pb424" name="v2pb424">424</a>]</span>country to stone. In the
Dresden Library there is an illuminated Persian MS., thought to be
seven hundred years old, which has in it what may be regarded as a
portrait of Ahriman and Iblis combined. He is red, has a heavy beard
and moustache, and there is a long dragon&rsquo;s crest and mane on his
head. He wears a green and blue skirt about his loins. His tongue rolls
thirstily between his cruel teeth. He superintends a number of
fish-like devils which float in a lake of fire, and swallow the damned.
Above this scene are the glorified souls, including the Shah sitting
cross-legged on his rug, who look down on the tortures beneath with
evident satisfaction. Apparently this is the only amusement which
relieves the <i>ennui</i> of their heaven.</p>
<p>If anything could make a rational man believe in a fiend-principle
in the universe it would be the suggestion of such pictures, that men
have existed who could conceive of happiness enjoyed in view of such
tortures as these. This and some similar pictures in the East&mdash;for
instance, that in the Temple of Horrors at Wuchang, China&mdash;are
absolutely rayless so far as any touch of humanity is concerned. Are
the Shah and his happy fellow-inspectors of tortures really fiends? In
the light of our present intelligence they may seem so. Certainly no
person of refined feeling could now expect to attain any heaven while
others were in hell. But it <i>would</i> be possible, if persons could
believe that many of those around them are not men and women at all,
but fiends in human shape. These ferocious Hells are referable to a
period when all who incurred the sentences of princes or priests were
seen as mere masks of devils; they were only ascribed human flesh that
they may suffer. The dogma of Hell was doomed from the moment that the
damned were supposed to be really human. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>Were those who killed the martyrs of heresy, for instance, to return
to the world and look upon those whom they pierced, they could never
recognise them. Were they to see the statues of Bruno, Huss, Cranmer,
Servetus, the names and forms would not recall to them the persons they
slew. They would be shocked if told that they had burned great men, and
would surely answer, &lsquo;Men? We burned no men. The Devil came among
us calling himself Huss, and we made short work with him; he reappeared
under several <i>aliases</i>&mdash;Bruno, Servetus, Spinoza, Voltaire:
sometimes we burned him, at other times managed to make him miserable,
thank God! But we were not hurting real men, we were saving
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Around such ideas grew our yet uncivilised Codes of Law. In England,
anno 1878, men are refused as jury-men if they will not say, &lsquo;So
help me God!&rsquo; on the ground that an atheist cannot have a
conscience. Only let him really be without conscience, and call himself
a christian when he is not, and courts receive the selfish liar with
respect. The old clause of the death-sentence&mdash;&lsquo;instigated
thereto by the Devil&rsquo;&mdash;has been dropped in the case of
murderers, however; and that is some gain. Torture by fire of the worst
murderer for one day would not be permitted in Christendom. Belief in
hell-fire outlasts it for a little among the ignorant. But what shall
be said of the educated who profess to believe it?</p>

<p>The Venerable Bede relates that, in the year 696, a Northumbrian
gentleman, who had died in the beginning of the night, came to life and
health in the morning, and gave an account of what he had seen
overnight. He had witnessed the conventional tortures of the damned,
but adds&mdash;&lsquo;Being thus on all sides enclosed with enemies and
darkness, and looking about on every side for assistance, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb426" href="#v2pb426" name=
"v2pb426">426</a>]</span>there appeared to me, on the way that I came,
as it were, the brightness of a star shining amidst the darkness, which
increased by degrees,&rsquo;&mdash;but we need not go on to the
anti-climax of this vision.</p>
<p>This star rising above all such visions belongs to the vault of the
human Love, and it is visible through all the Ages of Darkness. It
cannot be quenched, and its fiery rays have burnt up mountains of
iniquity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the year 1322,&rsquo; writes Fl&ouml;gel, after the
&lsquo;Chronicon Sampetrinum Erfurtense,&rsquo; &lsquo;there was a play
shown at Eisenach, which had a tragical enough effect. Markgraf
Friedrich of Misnia, Landgraf also of Thuringia, having brought his
tedious warfare to a conclusion, and the country beginning now to
revive under peace, his subjects were busy repaying themselves for the
past distresses by all manner of diversions; to which end, apparently
by the Sovereign&rsquo;s order, a dramatic representation of the <i>Ten
Virgins</i> was schemed, and at Eisenach, in his presence, duly
executed. This happened fifteen days after Easter, by indulgence of the
Preaching Friars. In the &lsquo;Chronicon Sampetrinum&rsquo; stands
recorded that the play was enacted in the Bear Garden (<i lang="la">in
horto ferarum</i>) by the Clergy and their Scholars. But now, when it
came to pass that the Wise Virgins would give the foolish no oil, and
these latter were shut out from the Bridegroom, they began to weep
bitterly, and called on the Saints to intercede for them; who however,
even with Mary at their head, could effect nothing from God; but the
Foolish Virgins were all sentenced to damnation. Which things the
Landgraf seeing and hearing, he fell into a doubt, and was very angry;
and said &lsquo;What then is the Christian Faith, if God will not take
pity on us for intercession of Mary and all the Saints?&rsquo; In this
anger he continued five days; and the learned men could hardly
enlighten him to understand <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb427"
href="#v2pb427" name="v2pb427">427</a>]</span>the Gospel. Thereupon he
was struck with apoplexy, and became speechless and powerless; in which
sad state he continued, bedrid, two years and seven months, and so
died, being then fifty-five.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In telling the story Carlyle remarks that these &lsquo;Ten Virgins
at Eisenach are more fatal to warlike men than &AElig;schylus&rsquo;
Furies at Athens were to weak women.&rsquo; Even so, until
great-hearted men rose up at Eisenach and elsewhere to begin the work
destined to prove fatal alike to heartless Virgins and Furies. That
star of a warrior&rsquo;s Compassion, hovering over the foolish Friars
and their midnight Gospel, beams far. The story reminds me of an
incident related of a mining district in California, where a rude
theatre was erected, and a company gave, as their first performance,
Othello. When the scene of Desdemona&rsquo;s suffocation approached, a
stalwart miner leaped on the stage, and pulling out his six-shooter,
said to the Moor, &lsquo;You damned nigger! if you touch that woman
I&rsquo;ll blow the top of your head off!&rsquo; A dozen roughs,
clambering over the footlights, cried, &lsquo;Right Joe! we&rsquo;ll
stand by you!&rsquo; The manager met the emergency by crying,
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot, boys! This play was wrote by Bill Shakespear;
he&rsquo;s an old Californian, and it&rsquo;s all in fun!&rsquo; Had
this Moor proceeded to roast Desdemona in fire with any verisimilitude,
it is doubtful if the manager could have saved him by an argument
reminding the miners that such was the divine way with sinners in the
region to which most of them were going. The top of that theologic
hell&rsquo;s head is not very safe in these days when human nature is
unchained with all its six-shooters, each liable to be touched off by
fire from that Star revolving in the sphere of Compassion.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Day after day I gazed upon Michael Angelo&rsquo;s &lsquo;Last
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb428" href="#v2pb428" name=
"v2pb428">428</a>]</span>Judgment&rsquo; in the Sistine Chapel. The
artist was in his sixtieth year when Pope Clement VII. invited him to
cover a wall sixty feet high and nearly as wide with a picture of the
Day of Wrath. In seven years he had finished it. Clement was dead. Pope
Paul IV. looked at it, and liked it not: all he could see was a vast
number of naked figures; so he said it was not fit for the Sistine
Chapel, and must be destroyed. One of Michael Angelo&rsquo;s pupils
saved it by draping some of the figures. Time went on, and another Pope
came who insisted on more drapery,&mdash;so the work was disfigured
again. However, popular ridicule saved this from going very far, and so
there remains the tremendous scene. But Popes and Cardinals always
disliked it. The first impression I received from it was that of a
complete representation of all the physical powers belonging to
organised life; though the forms are human, every animal power is
there, leaping, crouching, crawling,&mdash;every sinew, joint, muscle,
portrayed in completest tension and action. Then the eye wanders from
face to face, and every passion that ever crawled or prowled in jungle
or swamp is pictured. The most unpleasant expressions seemed to me
those of the martyrs. They came up from their graves, each bringing the
instrument by which he had suffered, and offering it in witness against
the poor wretches who came to be judged; and there was a look of
self-righteous satisfaction on their faces as they witnessed the
persecution of their persecutors. As for Christ, he was like a fury,
with hand uplifted against the doomed, his hair wildly floating. The
tortured people below are not in contrast with the blessed above; they
who are in heaven look rather more stupid than the others, and rather
pleased with the anguish they witness, but not more saintly. But
gradually the eye, having wandered over the vast canvas, from the
tortured <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb429" href="#v2pb429" name=
"v2pb429">429</a>]</span>Cardinal at the bottom up to the furious
Judge,&mdash;alights on a face which, once seen, is never to be
forgotten. Beautiful she is, that Mary beside the Judge, and more
beautiful for the pain that is on her face. She has drawn her drapery
to veil from her sight the anguish below; she has turned her face from
the Judge,&mdash;does not see her son in him; she looks not upon the
blessed,&mdash;for she, the gentle mother, is not in heaven; she cannot
have joy in sight of misery. In that one face of pure womanly
sympathy&mdash;that beauty transfigured in its
compassionateness&mdash;the artist put his soul, his religion.
Mary&rsquo;s face quenches all the painted flames. They are at once
made impossible. The same universe could not produce both a hell and
that horror of it. The furious Jesus is changed to a phantasm; he could
never be born of such a mother. If the Popes had only wished to hide
the nakedness of their own dogmas they ought to have blotted out
Mary&rsquo;s face; for as it now stands the rest of the forms are but
shapes to show how all the wild forms and passions of human animalism
gather as a frame round that which is their consummate
flower,&mdash;the spirit of love enshrined in its perfect human
expression.</p>
<p>So was it that Michael Angelo could not serve two masters. Popes
might employ him, but he could not do the work they liked. &lsquo;The
passive master lent his hand to the vast soul that o&rsquo;er him
planned.&rsquo; He could not help it. The lover of beauty could not
paint the Day of Wrath without setting above it that face like a star
which shines through its unreality, burns up its ugliness, and leaves
the picture a magnificent interpretation of the forms of nature and
hopes of the world,&mdash;a cardinal hypocrite at the bottom, an ideal
woman at the top.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Exhausted by the too-much glory of the visions of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb430" href="#v2pb430" name=
"v2pb430">430</a>]</span>Paradise which he had seen, Dante came forth
to the threshold opening on the world of human life, from which he had
parted for a space, and there sank down. As he lay there angels caused
lilies to grow beneath and around him, and myrtle to rise and
intertwine for a bower over him, and their happy voices, wafted in
low-toned hymns, brought soft sleep to his overwrought senses. Long had
he slumbered before the light of familiar day stole once more into
those deep eyes. The angels had departed. The poet awoke to find
himself alone, and with a sigh he said to himself, &lsquo;It is, then,
all but a dream.&rsquo; As he arose he saw before him a man of noble
mien and shining countenance, habited in an Eastern robe, who returned
his gaze with an interest equal to his own. Quickly the eyes of Dante
searched the ground beside the stranger to see if he were shadowless:
convinced thus that he was true flesh and blood, the Florentine thus
addressed him:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pilgrim, for such thou seemest, may we meet in simple human
brotherhood? If, as thy garb suggests, thou comest from afar, perchance
the friendly greeting, even of one who in his native city is still
himself a pilgrim, may not be unwelcome.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heart to heart be our kiss, my brother; yet must I journey
without delay to those who watch and wait for wondrous tidings that I
bear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Friend! I hear some meaning deeper than thy words. If
&lsquo;twere but as satisfying natural curiosity, answer not; but if
thou bearest a burden of tidings glad for all human-kind, speak! Who
art thou? whence comest, and with what message freighted?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Arda Vir&aacute;f is the name I bear; from Persia have I
come; but by what strange paths have reached this spot know I not, save
that through splendours of worlds invisible to mortal sense I have
journeyed, nor encountered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb431" href=
"#v2pb431" name="v2pb431">431</a>]</span>human form till I found thee
slumbering on this spot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trebly then art thou my brother! I too have but now, as to my
confused sense it seems, emerged from that vast journey. Thou clearest
from me gathering doubts that those visions were illusive. Yet, as even
things we really see are often overlaid by images that lurk in the eye,
I pray thee tell me something thou hast seen, so that perchance we may
part with mutual confirmation of our vision.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That gladly will I do. When the Avesta had been destroyed,
and the sages of Iran disagreed as to the true religion, they agreed
that one should be chosen by lot to drink the sacred draught of
Vishtasp, that he might pass to the invisible world and bring
intelligence therefrom. On me the lot fell. Beside the fire that has
never gone out, surrounded by holy women who chanted our hymns, I drank
the three cups&mdash;Well Thought, Well Said, Well Done. Then as I
slept there rose before me a high stairway of three steps; on the first
was written, Well Thought; on the second, Well Said; on the third, Well
Done. By the first step I reached the realm where good thoughts are
honoured: there were the thinkers whose starlike radiance ever
increased. They offered no prayers, they chanted no liturgies. Above
all was the sphere of the liberal. The next step brought me to the
circle of great and truthful speakers: these walked in lofty splendour.
The third step brought me to the heaven of good actions. I saw the
souls of agriculturists surrounded by spirits of water and earth, trees
and cattle. The artisans were seated on embellished thrones. Sublime
were the seats of teachers, interceders, peace-makers; and the
religious walked in light and joy with which none are satiated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sawest thou the fairest of earth-born ladies&mdash;Beatrice?
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb432" href="#v2pb432" name=
"v2pb432">432</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw indeed a lady most fair. In a pleasant grove lay the
form of a man who had but then parted from earth. When he had awakened,
he walked through the grove and there met him this most beautiful
maiden. To her he said, &lsquo;Who art thou, so fair beyond all whom I
have seen in the land of the living?&rsquo; To him she replied,
&lsquo;O youth, I am thy actions.&rsquo; Can this be thy lady
Beatrice?</p>
<p>&lsquo;But sawest thou no hell? no dire punishments?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alas! sad scenes I witnessed, sufferers whose hell was that
their darkness was amid the abodes of splendour. Amid all that glow one
newly risen from earth walked shivering with cold, and there walked
ever by his side a hideous hag. On her he turned and said, &lsquo;Who
art thou, that ever movest beside me, thou that art monstrous beyond
all that I have seen on earth?&rsquo; To him she replied, &lsquo;Man, I
am thy actions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But who were those glorious ones thou sawest in Paradise?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some of their names I did indeed learn&mdash;Zoroaster,
Socrates, Plato, Buddha, Confucius, Christ.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do I hear! knowest thou that none of these save that
last holy one&mdash;whom methinks thou namest too lightly among
men&mdash;were baptized? Those have these eyes sorrowfully beheld in
pain through the mysterious justice of God.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thinkest thou, then, thy own compassion deeper than the mercy
of Ormuzd? But, ah! now indeed I do remember. As I conversed with the
sages I had named, they related to me this strange event. By guidance
of one of their number, Virgil by name, there had come among them from
the earth a most powerful magician. He bore the name of Dante. By
mighty spells this being had cast them all into a sad circle which he
called Limbo, over whose gate he wrote, though with eyes full of tears,
&lsquo;All <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb433" href="#v2pb433" name=
"v2pb433">433</a>]</span>hope abandon, ye who enter here!&rsquo; Thus
were they in great sorrow and dismay. But, presently, as this strange
Dante was about to pass on, so they related, he looked upon the face of
one among them so pure and noble that though he had styled him
&lsquo;pagan,&rsquo; he could not bear to abandon him there. This was
Cato of Utica. Him this Dante led to the door, and gave him liberty on
condition that he would be warder of his unbaptized brethren, and by no
means let any of them escape. No sooner, however, was this done than
this magician beheld others who moved his reverence,&mdash;among them
Trajan and Ripheus,&mdash;and overcome by an impulse of love, he opened
a window in the side of Limbo, bidding them emerge into light. He then
waved his christian wand to close up this aperture, and passed away,
supposing that he had done so; but the limit of that magician&rsquo;s
power had been reached, the window was but veiled, and after he had
gone all these unbaptized ones passed out by that way, and reascended
to the glory they had enjoyed before this Dante had brought his alien
sorceries to bear upon them for a brief space.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can this be true? Is it indeed so that all the sages and
poets of the world are now in equal rank whether or not they have been
sealed as members of Christ?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Brother, thy brow is overcast. What! can one so pure and high
of nature as thou desire that the gentle Christ, whom I saw embracing
the sages and prophets of other ages, should turn upon them with hatred
and bind them in gloom and pain like this Dante?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, with a flood of tears, Dante fell at the feet of Arda
Vir&aacute;f, and kissed the hem of his skirt. &lsquo;Purer is thy
vision, O pilgrim, than mine,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I fear that I have
but borne with me to the invisible world the small prejudices of my
little Church, which hath taught me to limit <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb434" href="#v2pb434" name=
"v2pb434">434</a>]</span>the Love which I now see to be boundless. Thou
who hast learned from thy Zoroaster that the meaning of God is the end
of all evil, a universe climbing to its flower in joy, deign to take
the hand of thy servant and make him worthy to be thy
friend,&mdash;with thee henceforth to abandon the poor formulas which
ignorance substitutes for virtue, and ascend to the beautiful summits
thou has visited by the stairway of good thoughts, good words, good
deeds.&rsquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In 1745 Swedenborg was a student of Natural Philosophy in London. In
the April of that year his &lsquo;revelations&rsquo; began amid the
smoke and toil of the great metropolis. &lsquo;I was hungry and ate
with great appetite. Towards the end of the meal I remarked a kind of
mist spread before my eyes, and I saw the floor of my room covered with
hideous reptiles, such as serpents, toads, and the like. I was
astonished, having all my wits about me, being perfectly conscious. The
darkness attained its height and then passed away. I now saw a Man
sitting in the corner of the chamber. As I had thought myself alone, I
was greatly frightened when he said to me, &lsquo;Eat not as
much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In Swedenborg&rsquo;s Diary the incident is related more
particularly. &lsquo;In the middle of the day, at dinner, an Angel
spoke to me, and told me not to eat too much at table. Whilst he was
with me, there plainly appeared to me a kind of vapour steaming from
the pores of my body. It was a most visible watery vapour, and fell
downwards to the ground upon the carpet, where it collected and turned
into divers vermin, which were gathered together under the table, and
in a moment went off with a pop or noise. A fiery light appeared within
them, and a sound was heard, pronouncing that all the vermin that could
possibly be generated by unseemly appetite were thus cast <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb435" href="#v2pb435" name=
"v2pb435">435</a>]</span>out of my body, and burnt up, and that I was
now cleansed from them. Hence we may know what luxury and the like have
for their bosom contents.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Continuing the first account Swedenborg said, &lsquo;The following
night the same Man appeared to me again. I was this time not at all
alarmed. The Man said, &lsquo;I am God, the Lord, the Creator, and
Redeemer of the world. I have chosen thee to unfold to men the
spiritual sense of the Holy Scripture. I will myself dictate to thee
what thou shalt write.&rsquo; The same night the world of spirits, hell
and heaven, were convincingly opened to me, where I found many persons
of my acquaintance of all conditions. From that day forth I gave up all
worldly learning, and laboured only in spiritual things, according to
what the Lord commanded me to write.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He &lsquo;gave up all worldly learning,&rsquo; shut his intellectual
eyes, and sank under all the nightmares which his first vision saw
burnt up as vermin. After his fiftieth year, says Emerson, he falls
into jealousy of his intellect, makes war on it, and the violence is
instantly avenged. But the portrait of the blinded mystic as drawn by
the clear seer is too impressive an illustration to be omitted
here.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A vampyre sits in the seat of the prophet and turns with
gloomy appetite to the images of pain. Indeed, a bird does not more
readily weave its nest or a mole bore in the ground than this seer of
the souls substructs a new hell and pit, each more abominable than the
last, round every new crew of offenders. He was let down through a
column that seemed of brass, but it was formed of angelic spirits, that
he might descend safely amongst the unhappy, and witness the vastation
of souls; and heard there, for a long continuance, their lamentations;
he saw their tormentors, who increase and strain pangs to infinity; he
saw the hell of the jugglers, the hell of the assassins, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb436" href="#v2pb436" name=
"v2pb436">436</a>]</span>hell of the lascivious; the hell of robbers,
who kill and boil men; the infernal tun of the deceitful; the
excrementitious hells; the hell of the revengful, whose faces resembled
a round, broad cake, and their arms rotate like a wheel.... The
universe, in his poem, suffers under a magnetic sleep, and only
reflects the mind of the magnetiser.... Swedenborg and Behmon both
failed by attaching themselves to the christian symbol, instead of to
the moral sentiment, which carries innumerable christianities,
humanities, divinities, in its bosom.... Another dogma, growing out of
this pernicious theologic limitation, is this Inferno. Swedenborg has
devils. Evil, according to old philosophers, is good in the making.
That pure malignity can exist, is the extreme proposition of
unbelief.... To what a painful perversion had Gothic theology arrived,
that Swedenborg admitted no conversion for evil spirits! But the divine
effort is never relaxed; the carrion in the sun will convert itself to
grass and flowers; and man, though in brothels, or jails, or on
gibbets, is on his way to all that is good and true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But even the Hell of Swedenborg is not free from the soft potency of
our star. It is almost painful, indeed, to see its spiritual ray
mingling with the fiery fever-shapes which Swedenborg meets on his way
through the column of brass,&mdash;made, had he known it, not of angels
but of savage scriptures. &lsquo;I gave up all worldly
learning&rsquo;&mdash;he says: but it did not give him up all at once.
&lsquo;They (the damned) suffer ineffable torments; but it was
permitted to relieve or console them with a certain degree of hope, so
that they should not entirely despair. For they said they believed the
torment would be eternal. They were relieved or consoled by saying that
God Messiah is merciful, and that in His Word we read that &lsquo;the
prisoners will be sent forth from the pit&rsquo; (Zech. ix. 2).
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb437" href="#v2pb437" name=
"v2pb437">437</a>]</span>Swedenborg reports that God Messiah appeared
to these spirits, and even embraced and kissed one who had been raised
from &lsquo;the greatest torment.&rsquo; He says, &lsquo;Punishment for
the sake of punishment is the punishment of a devil,&rsquo; and affirms
that all punishment is &lsquo;to take away evils or to induce a faculty
of doing good.&rsquo; These utterances are in his Diary, and were
written before he had got to the bottom of his Calvinistic column; but
even in the &lsquo;Arcana Celestia&rsquo; there is a
gleam:&mdash;&lsquo;Such is the equilibrium of all things in another
life that evil punishes itself, and unless it were removed by
punishments the evil spirits must necessarily be kept in some hell to
eternity.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Reductio ad absurdum!</i> And yet Swedenborgians insist upon the
dogma of everlasting punishments; to sustain which they appeal from
Swedenborg half-sober to Swedenborg mentally drunk.</p>

<p>In the Library at Dresden there is a series of old pictures said to
be Mexican, and which I was told had been purchased from a Jew in
Vienna, containing devils mainly of serpent characters blended with
those of humanity. One was a fantastic serpent with human head, sharp
snoutish nose, many eyes, slight wings, and tongue lolling out. Another
had a human head and reptilian tail. A third is human except for the
double tongue darting out. A fourth has issuing from the back of his
head a serpent whose large dragon head is swallowing a human embryo.
Whatever tribe it was that originated these pictures must have had very
strong impressions of the survival of the serpent in some men.</p>
<p>I was reminded of the picture of the serpent swallowing the human
embryo while looking at the wall-pictures in Russian churches
representing the conventional serpent with devils nestling at intervals
along its body, as represented <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb438"
href="#v2pb438" name="v2pb438">438</a>]</span>in our Figure (<a href=
"#v2fig10">10</a>). Professor Buslaef gave me the right
arch&aelig;ology of this, no doubt, but the devils themselves, as I
gazed, seemed to intimate another theory with their fair forms. They
might have been winged angels but for their hair of flame and cruel
hooks. They seemed to say, &lsquo;We were the ancient embryo-gods of
the human imagination, but the serpent swallowed us. He swallowed us
successively as one after another we availed ourselves of his cunning
in our priesthoods; as we brought his cruel coils to crush those who
dared to outgrow our cult; as we imitated his fang in the deadliness
with which we bit the heel of every advancing thinker; as, when worsted
in our struggle against reason, we took to the double tongue, praising
with one fork the virtues which we poisoned with the other. Now we are
degraded with him for ever, bound to him by these rings, labelled with
the sins we have committed.&rsquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>It was by a true experience that the ancients so generally took
nocturnal animals to be types of diabolism. Corresponding to them are
the sleepless activities of morally unawakened men. The animal is a
sleeping man. Its passions and instincts are acted out in what to
rational man would be dreams. In dreams, especially when influenced by
disease, a man may mentally relapse very far, and pass through kennels
and styes, which are such even when somewhat decorated by shreds of the
familiar human environment. The nocturnal form of intellect is cunning;
the obscuration of religion is superstition; the dark shadow that falls
on love turns it to lust. These wolves and bats, on which no ideal has
dawned, do not prowl or flit through man in their natural forms: in the
half-awake consciousness, whose starlight attends man amid his
darkness, their misty outlines swell, and in the feverish unenlightened
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb439" href="#v2pb439" name=
"v2pb439">439</a>]</span>conscience they become phantasms of his
animalism&mdash;werewolves, vampyres. The awakening of reason in any
animal is through all the phases of cerebral and social evolution. A
wise man said to his son who was afraid to enter the dark, &lsquo;Go
on, child; you will never see anything worse than yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The hare-lip, which we sometimes see in the human face, is there an
arrested development. Every lip is at some embryonic period a hare-lip.
The development of man&rsquo;s visible part has gone on much longer
than his intellectual and moral evolution, and abnormalities in it are
rare in comparison with the number of survivals from the animal world
in his temper, his faith, and his manners. Criminals are men living out
their arrested moral developments. They who regard them as instigated
by a devil are those whose arrest is mental. The eye of reason will
deal with both all the more effectively, because with as little wrath
as a surgeon feels towards the hare-lip he endeavours to humanise.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>It is an impressive fact that the great and reverent mind of
Spinoza, in pondering the problem of Evil and the theology which
ascribed it to a Devil, was unconsciously led to anticipate by more
than a century the first (modern) scientific suggestions of the
principle of Evolution. In his early treatise, &lsquo;De Deo et
Homine,&rsquo; occurs this short but momentous chapter&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="sc">De Diabolis.</span> If the Devil be an
Entity contrary in all respects to God, having nothing of God in his
nature, there can be nothing in common with God.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he assumed to be a thinking Entity, as some will have it,
who never wills and never does any good, and who sets himself in
opposition to God on all occasions, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb440" href="#v2pb440" name="v2pb440">440</a>]</span>would assuredly
be a very wretched being, and, could prayers do anything for him, his
amendment were much to be implored.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But let us ask whether so miserable an object could exist
even for an instant; and, the question put, we see at once that it
could not; for from the perfection of a thing proceeds its power of
continuance: the more of the Essential and Divine a thing possesses,
the more enduring it is. But how could the Devil, having no trace of
perfection in him, exist at all? Add to this, that the stability or
duration of a thinking thing depends entirely on its love of and union
with God, and that the opposite of this state in every particular being
presumed in the Devil, it is obviously impossible that there can be any
such being.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then there is indeed no necessity to presume the
existence of a Devil; for the causes of hate, envy, anger, and all such
passions are readily enough to be discovered; and there is no occasion
for resort to fiction to account for the evils they
engender.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the course of his correspondence with the most learned men of his
time, Spinoza was severely questioned concerning his views upon human
wickedness, the disobedience of Adam, and so forth. He said&mdash;to
abridge his answers&mdash;If there be any essential or positive evil in
men, God is the author and continuer of that evil. But what is called
evil in them is their degree of imperfection as compared with those
more perfect. Adam, in the abstract, is a man eating an apple. That is
not in itself an evil action. Acts condemned in man are often admired
in animals,&mdash;as the jealousy of doves,&mdash;and regarded as
evidence of their perfection. Although man must restrain the forces of
nature and direct them to his purposes, it is a superstition to suppose
that God is angry against such forces. It is an error in man to
identify his little inconveniences <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb441" href="#v2pb441" name="v2pb441">441</a>]</span>as obstacles to
God. Let him withdraw himself from the consideration and nothing is
found evil. Whatever exists, exists by reason of its perfection for its
own ends,&mdash;which may or may not be those of men.</p>
<p>Spinoza&rsquo;s aphorism, &lsquo;From the perfection of a thing
proceeds its power of continuance,&rsquo; is the earliest modern
statement of the doctrine now called &lsquo;survival of the
fittest.&rsquo; The notion of a Devil involves the solecism of a being
surviving through its unfitness for survival.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Spinoza was Copernicus of the moral Cosmos. The great German who
discovered to men that their little planet was not the one centre and
single care of nature, led the human mind out of a closet and gave it a
universe. But dogma still clung to the closet; where indeed each sect
still remains, holding its little interest to be the aim of the solar
system, and all outside it to be part of a countless host, marshalled
by a Prince of Evil, whose eternal war is waged against that formidable
pulpiteer whose sermon is sending dismay through pandemonium. But for
rational men all that is ended, and its decline began when Spinoza
warned men against looking at the moral universe from the pin-hole of
their egotism. That closet-creation, whose laws were seen now acting
now suspended to suit the affairs of men, disappeared, and man was led
to adore the All.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>It is a small thing that man can bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head, if
its fang still carries its venom so deep in his reason as to blacken
all nature with a sense of triumphant malevolence. To the eye of
judicial man, instructed to decide every case without bribe of his own
interest as a rival animal, the serpent&rsquo;s fang is one of the most
perfect adaptations of means to ends in nature. Were a corresponding
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb442" href="#v2pb442" name=
"v2pb442">442</a>]</span>perfection in every human mind, the world
would fulfil the mystical dream of the East, which gave one name to the
serpents that bit them in the wilderness and seraphim singing round the
eternal throne.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&lsquo;Cursed be the Hebrew who shall either eat pork, or permit his
son to be instructed in the learning of the Greeks.&rsquo; So says the
Talmud, with a voice transmitted from the &lsquo;kingdom of
priests&rsquo; (Exod. xix. 6). From the altar of &lsquo;unhewn
stone&rsquo; came the curse upon Art, and upon the race that
represented culture raising its tool upon the rudeness of nature. That
curse of the Talmud recoiled fearfully. The Jewish priesthood had their
son in Peter with his vision of clean and unclean animals, and the
command, &lsquo;Slay and eat!&rsquo; Uninstructed is this heir of
priestly Judaism &lsquo;in the learning of the Greeks,&rsquo;
consequently his way of converting Gentiles&mdash;the herd of swine,
the <i>goyim</i>&mdash;is to convert them into christian protoplasm.
&lsquo;Slay and eat,&rsquo; became the cry of the elect, and their
first victim was the paternal Jew who taught them that pork and Greek
learning belonged to the same category.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>But there was another Jewish nation not composed of priests. While
the priestly kingdom is typified in Jonah announcing the destruction of
Nineveh, who, because the great city still goes on, reproaches Jehovah,
the nation of the poets has now its Jehovah II. who sees the
humiliation of the tribal priesthood as a withered gourd compared with
the arts, wealth, and human interests of a Gentile city. &lsquo;The
Lord repented.&rsquo; The first Gospel to the Gentiles is in that
gentle thought for the uncircumcised Ninevites. But it was reached too
late. When it gained expression in Christ welcoming Greeks, and seeing
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb443" href="#v2pb443" name=
"v2pb443">443</a>]</span>stones possible &lsquo;children of
Abraham;&rsquo; in Paul acknowledging debt to barbarians and taking his
texts from Greek altars or poets; the evolution of the ideal element in
Hebrew religion had gained much. But historic combinations raised the
judaisers to a throne, and all the narrowness of their priesthood was
re-enacted as Christianity.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The column of brass in whose hollow centre the fine brain of
Swedenborg was imprisoned is a fit similitude of the christian formula.
The whole moral attitude of Christianity towards nature is represented
in his first vision. The beginning of his spiritual career is announced
by the evaporation of his animal nature in the form of vermin. The
christian hell is present, and these <span class="corr" id="xd20e15044"
title="Source: aminal">animal</span> parts are burnt up. Among those
burnt-up powers of Swedenborg, one of the serpents must have been his
intellect. &lsquo;From that day forth I gave up all worldly
learning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here we have the ideal christian caught up to his paradise even
while his outward shape is visible. But what if we were all to become
like that? Suppose all the animal powers and desires were to evaporate
out of mankind and to be burnt up! Were that to occur to-day the effect
on the morrow would be but faintly told in that which would be caused
by sudden evaporations of steam from all the engines of the world. We
may imagine a band of philanthropists, sorely disturbed by the number
of accidents incidental to steam-locomotion, who should conspire to go
at daybreak to all the engine-houses and stations in England, and, just
as the engines were about to start for their work, should quench their
fires, let off their steam, and break their works. That would be but a
brief paralysis of the work of one country; but what would be the
result if the animal nature of man and its desires, the works and
trades that minister to the &lsquo;pomps <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb444" href="#v2pb444" name="v2pb444">444</a>]</span>and
vanities,&rsquo; all worldly aims and joys, should be burnt up in fires
of fanaticism!</p>
<p>Yet to that fatal aim Christianity gave itself,&mdash;so contrary to
that great heart in which was mirrored the beautiful world, its lilies
and little children, and where love shed its beams on the just and the
unjust! The organising principle of Christianity was that which
crucified Jesus and took his tomb for corner-stone of a system modelled
after what he hated. Its central purpose was to effect a divorce
between the moral and the animal nature of man. One is called flesh and
the other spirit; one was the child of God, the other the child of the
Devil. It rent asunder that which was really one; its whole history, so
long as it was in earnest, was the fanatical effort to keep asunder by
violence those two halves ever seeking harmony; its history since its
falsity was exposed has been the hypocrisy of professing in word what
is impossible in deed.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Beside the christian vision of Swedenborg, in which the judaic
priest&rsquo;s curse on swinish Greek learning found apotheosis, let us
set the vision of a Jewish seer in whom the humanity that spared
Nineveh found expression. The seer is Philo,&mdash;name rightly
belonging to that pure mind in which the starry ideals of his Semitic
race embraced the sensuous beauty which alone could give them life.
Philo (Pr&aelig;m. et P&oelig;nis, sec. 15&ndash;20) describes as the
first joy of the redeemed earth the termination of the war between man
and animal. That war will end, he says, &lsquo;when the wild beasts in
the soul have been tamed. Then the most ferocious animals will submit
to man; scorpions will lose their stings, and serpents their poison.
And, in consequence of the suppression of that older war between man
and beast, the war between man and man shall also end.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb445" href="#v2pb445" name=

<p>Here we emerge from Swedenborg&rsquo;s brass column, we pass beyond
Peter&rsquo;s sword called &lsquo;Slay-and-eat,&rsquo; we leave behind
the Talmud&rsquo;s curse on swine and learning: we rise to the clear
vision of Hebrew prophecy which beheld lion and lamb lying down
together, a child leading the wild forces subdued by culture.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&lsquo;Why not God kill Debbil?&rsquo; asked Man Friday. It is a
question which not even Psychology has answered, why no Theology has
yet suggested the death of the Devil in the past, or prophesied more
than chains for him in the future. No doubt the need of a
&lsquo;hangman&rsquo;s whip to haud the wretch in order&rsquo; may
partly account for it; but with this may have combined a cause of which
it is pleasanter to think&mdash;Devils being animal passions in excess,
even the ascetic recoils from their destruction, with an instinct like
that which restrains rats from gnawing holes through the ship&rsquo;s
bottom.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In Goethe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Faust&rsquo; we read, <i lang="de">Doch das
Antike find&rsquo; ich zu lebendig</i>. It is a criticism on the nudity
of the Greek forms that appear in the classical Walpurgis Night. But
the authority is not good: it is Mephistopheles who is disgusted with
sight of the human form, and he says they ought in modern fashion to be
plastered over. His sentiments have prevailed at the Vatican, where the
antique statues and the great pictures of Michael Angelo bear witness
to the prurient prudery of the papal mind. &lsquo;Devils are our

<hr class="tb">
<p>Herodotus (ii. 47) says, &lsquo;The Egyptians consider the pig to be
an impure beast, and therefore if a man, in passing by a pig, should
touch him only with his garments, he forthwith goes to the river and
plunges in; and, in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb446" href=
"#v2pb446" name="v2pb446">446</a>]</span>next place, swineherds,
although native Egyptians, are the only men who are not allowed to
enter any of their temples.&rsquo; The Egyptians, he says, do not
sacrifice the goat; &lsquo;and, indeed, their painters and sculptors
represent Pan with the face and legs of a goat, as the Grecians do; not
that they imagine this to be his real form, for they think him like
other gods; but why they represent him in this way I had rather not
mention.&rsquo; We need not feel the same prudery. The Egyptians
rightly regarded the symbol of sexual desire, on whose healthy exercise
the perpetuation of life depended, as a very different kind of
animalism from that symbolised in the pig&rsquo;s love of refuse and
garbage. Their association of the goat with Pan&mdash;the lusty vigour
of nature&mdash;was the natural preface to the arts of Greece in which
the wild forces were taught their first lesson&mdash;Temperance. Pan
becomes musical. The vigour and vitality of human nature find in the
full but not excessive proportions of Apollo, Aphrodite, Artemis, and
others of the bright array, the harmony which Pan with his pipe
preludes. The Greek statue is soul embodied and body ensouled.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Two men had I the happiness to know in my youth, into whose faces I
looked up and saw the throne of Genius illumined by Purity. One of
them, Ralph Waldo Emerson, wrote, &lsquo;If beauty, softness, and faith
in female forms have their own influence, vices even, in a slight
degree, are thought to improve the expression.&rsquo; The other, Arthur
Hugh Clough, wrote, &lsquo;What we all love is good touched up with
evil.&rsquo; Here are two brave flowers, of which one grew out of the
thorny stem of Puritanism, the other from the monastic root of Oxford.
The &lsquo;vices&rsquo; which could improve the expression, even for
the pure eyes of Emerson, are those which represent the struggle
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb447" href="#v2pb447" name=
"v2pb447">447</a>]</span>of human nature to exist in truth, albeit in
misdirection and reaction, amid pious hypocrisies. The Oxonian scholar
had seen enough of the conventionalised characterless
&lsquo;good&rsquo; to long for some sign of life and freedom, even
though it must come as a touch of &lsquo;evil.&rsquo; To the artist,
nature is never seen in petrifaction; it is really as well as literally
<i>a becoming</i>. The evil he sees is &lsquo;good in the
making:&rsquo; what others call vices are voices in the wilderness
preparing the way of the highest.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&lsquo;God and the Devil make the whole of Religion,&rsquo; said
Nicoli&mdash;speaking, perhaps, better than he knew. The culture of the
world has shown that the sometime opposed realms of human interest, so
personified, are equally essential. It is through this experience that
the Devil has gained such ample vindication from the poets&mdash;as in
Rapisardi&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lucifero,&rsquo; a veritable &lsquo;bringer of
Light,&rsquo; and Cranch&rsquo;s &lsquo;Satan.&rsquo; From the latter
work (&lsquo;Satan: A Libretto.&rsquo; Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1874),
which should be more widely known, I quote some lines. Satan
says&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd20e2305">I symbolise the wild and deep</p>
<p class="line">And unregenerated wastes of life,</p>

<p class="line">And tendency unbalanced by due weight</p>

tints one cannot transfix their sense. They seemed to me just now the
primal conditions, by fulfilling which anything might be attained,
without which, nothing. But now (yet perhaps the difference is not
great) I see the Mothers to be the ancient healthy instincts and ideals
of our race. These took shape in forms of art, whose evolution had been
man&rsquo;s harmony with himself. Christianity, borrowing thunder of
one god, hammer of another, shattered them&mdash;shattered our Mothers!
And now learned travellers go about in many lands saying, &lsquo;Saw ye
my beloved?&rsquo; Amid cities ruined and buried we are trying to

half-conscious that we are piecing together again the fragments of our

<p>&lsquo;The Devil: <i>Does he Exist, and what does he Do?</i>&rsquo;
Such is the title of a recent work by Father Delaporte, Professor of
Dogma in the Faculty of Bordeaux. He gives specific directions for
exorcism of devils by means of holy water, the sign of the cross, and
other charms. &lsquo;These measures,&rsquo; says one of his American
critics, &lsquo;may answer very well against the French Devil; but our
American Beelzebub is a potentate that goeth not forth on any such
hints.&rsquo; Father Delaporte would hardly contend that the use of
cross and holy water for a thousand years has been effectual in
dislodging the European Beelzebub.</p>
<p>On the whole, I am inclined to prefer the method of the Africans of
the Guinea Coast. They believe in a particularly hideous devil, but say
that the only defence they require against him is a mirror. If any one
will keep a mirror beside him, the Devil must see himself in it, and he
at once rushes away in terror of his own ugliness. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb449" href="#v2pb449" name=
"v2pb449">449</a>]</span></p>
<p>No monster ever conjured up by imagination is more hideous than a
rational being transformed to a beast. Just that is every human being
who has brought his nobler powers down to be slaves of his animal
nature. No eye could look upon that fearful sight unmoved. All man
needs is a true mirror in which his own animalism may see itself. We
cannot borrow for this purpose the arts of Greece, nor the fairy ideals
of Germany, nor the emasculated saints of Christendom. These were but
fragments of the man who has been created by combination of their
powers, and their several ideals are broken bits that cannot reflect
the whole being of man in its proportions or disproportions.</p>
<p>The higher nature of man, polished by culture of all his faculties,
can alone be the faithful mirror before his lower. The clearness of
this mirror in the individual heart depends mainly on the civilisation
and knowledge surrounding it. The discovered law turns once plausible
theories to falsehoods; a noble literature transmutes once popular
books to trash. When Art interprets the realities of nature, when it
shows how much beauty and purity our human nature is capable of, it
holds a mirror before all deformities. At a theatre in the city of
London, I witnessed the performance of an actor who, in the course of
his part, struck a child. He was complimented by a hurricane of hisses
from the crowded gallery. Had those &lsquo;gods&rsquo; up there never
struck children? Possibly. Yet here each had a mirror before him and
recoiled from his worst self. A clergyman relates that, while looking
at pictures in the Bethnal Green Museum, he overheard a poor woman, who
had been gazing on a Madonna, say, &lsquo;If I had such a child as that
I believe I could be a good woman.&rsquo; Who can say what even that
one glance at her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb450" href=
"#v2pb450" name="v2pb450">450</a>]</span>life in the ideal reflector
may be worth to that wanderer amid the miseries and temptations of
London!</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>It is not easy for those who have seen what is high and holy to give
their hearts to what is base and unholy. It is as natural for human
nature to love virtue as to love any other beauty. External beauty is
visible to all, and all desire it: the interior beauty is not visible
to superficial glances, but the admiration shown even for its
counterfeits shows how natural it is to admire virtue. But in order
that the charm of this moral beauty may be felt by human nature it must
be related to that nature&mdash;real. It must not be some childish
ideal which answers to no need of the man of to-day; not something
imported from a time and place where it had meaning and force to others
where it has none.</p>
<p>When dogmas surviving from the primitive world are brought to behold
themselves in the mirror held up by Science, they cry out, &lsquo;That
is not my face! You are caricaturing my beliefs!&rsquo; This recoil of
Superstition from its own ugliness is the victory of Religion. What
priests bewail as disbelief is faith fleeing from its deformities.
Ignorant devotion proves its need of Science by its terrors of the
same, which are like those of the horse at first sight of its best
friend, bearer of its burthens&mdash;the locomotive.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Religion, like every other high feature of human nature, has its
animal counterpart. The animalised religion is superstition. It has
various expressions,&mdash;the abjectness of one form, the ferocity of
another, the cunning of a third. It is unconscious of anything higher
than animalism. Its god is a very great animal preying on other
animals, which are laid on his altars; or pleased when smaller animals
give up their part of the earthly <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb451" href="#v2pb451" name="v2pb451">451</a>]</span>feast by
starving their passions and senses. Under the growth of civilisation
and intelligence that pious asceticism is revealed in its true
form,&mdash;intensified animalism. The asceticism of one age becomes
the self-indulgence of another. The two-footed animal having discovered
that his god does not eat the meat left for him, eats it himself.
Learning that he gets as much from his god by a wafer and a prayer, he
offers these and retains the gifts, treasures, and pleasures so
commuted,&mdash;these, however, being withdrawn from the direction of
the higher nature by the fact of being obtained through the conditions
of the lower, and dependent on their persistence. In process of time
the forms and formulas of religion, detached from all
reality&mdash;such as no conceivable monarch could desire&mdash;not
only become senseless, but depend upon their senselessness for
continuance. They refuse to come at all within the domain of reason or
common-sense, and trust to mental torpor of the masses, force of habit
in the aggregate, self-interest in the wealthy and powerful, bribes for
thinkers and scholars.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Animalism disguised as a religion must render the human religion,
able to raise passions into divine attributes of a perfect manhood,
impossible so long as it continues. That a human religion can ever come
by any process of evolution from a superstition which can only exist by
ministry to the baser motives is a delusion. The only hope of society
is that its independent minds may gain culture, and so surround this
unextinct monster with mirrors that it may perish through shame at its
manifold deformities. These are symbolised in the many-headed phantasm
which is the subject of this work. Demon, Dragon, and Devil have long
paralysed the finest powers of man, peopling nature with horrors, the
heart <span class="pagenum">[<a id="v2pb452" href="#v2pb452" name=
"v2pb452">452</a>]</span>with fears, and causing the religious
sentiment itself to make actual in history the worst excesses it
professed to combat in its imaginary adversaries. My largest hope is
that from the dragon-guarded well where Truth is too much concealed she
may emerge far enough to bring her mirror before these phantoms of
fear, and with far-darting beams send them back to their caves in Chaos
and ancient Night.</p>

belly, the same tongue lolling out&mdash;as in our figures of Typhon
and Kali. Drunkenness has three animal heads&mdash;one of a degraded
humanity, another a sheep, the third a goose. Cruelty is a werewolf; a
frog-faced Lamia represents its mixture with Lust; and other vices are
represented by other monsters, chiefly dragons with griffin forms,
until the last is reached&mdash;the Devil, who is just opposite the
Governor&rsquo;s symbols across the quadrangle.</p>
<p>So was represented, some centuries ago, the conflict of Ormuzd and
Ahriman, for the young soldiers who enlisted at Oxford for that
struggle. A certain amount of fancy <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb453" href="#v2pb453" name="v2pb453">453</a>]</span>has entered
into the execution of the figures; but, if this be carefully detached,
the history which I have attempted to tell in these volumes may be
generally traced in the Magdalen statues. Each represents some phase in
the advance of the world, when, under new emergencies, earlier symbols
were modified, recombined, and presently replaced by new shapes. It was
found inadequate to keep the scholar throwing stones at the mummy of
Goliath when by his side was living Gluttony in religious garb. The
scriptural symbols are gradually mixed with those of Greek and German
mythology, and by such contact with nature are able to generate forms,
whose lolling tongues, wide mouths, and other expressions, represent
with some realism the physiognomies of brutality let loose through
admission to human shape and power.</p>
<p>It may be that, when they were set up, the young Oxonian passed
shuddering these terrible forms, dreaded these werewolves and
succub&aelig;, and dreamed of going forth to impale dragons. But now
the sculptures excite only laughter or curiosity, when they are not
passed by without notice. Yet the old conflict between Light and
Darkness has not ceased. The ancient forms of it pass away; they become
grotesque. Such was necessarily the case where the excessive
mythological and fanciful elements introduced at one period fall upon
another period when they hide the meaning. Their obscurity, even for
antiquarians, marks how far away from those cold battlefields the
struggle they symbolised has passed. But it ceases not. Some scholars
who listen to the sweet vespers of Magdalen may think the conflict
over; if so, even poor brother Moody may enter the true kingdom before
them; for, when preaching in Baltimore last September, he said,
&lsquo;Men are possessed of devils just as much now as they ever were.
The devil of rum is as great as any that ever <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="v2pb454" href="#v2pb454" name=
"v2pb454">454</a>]</span>lived. Why cannot this one and all others be
cast out? Because there is sin in the christian camp.&rsquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The picture which closes this volume has been made for me by the
artist Hennessey, to record an incident which occurred at the door of
N&ocirc;tre Dame in Paris last summer. I had been examining an ugly
devil there treading down human forms into hell; but a dear friend
looked higher, and saw a bird brooding over its young on a nest
supported by that same horrible head.</p>
<p>So, above the symbols of wrath in nature, Love still interweaves
heavenly tints with the mystery of life; beside the horns of pain
prepares melodies.</p>
<p>Even so, also, over the animalism which deforms man, rises the
animal perfection which shames that; here ascending above the reign of
violence by a feather&rsquo;s force, and securing to that little
creature a tenderness that could best express the heart of a Christ,
when it would gather humanity under his wings.</p>
<p>This same little scene at the cathedral door came before me again as
I saw the Oxonian youth, with their morning-faces, passing so
heedlessly those ancient sculptures at Magdalen. Over every happy heart
the same old love was brooding, in each nestling faculties were trying
to gain their wings. To what will they aspire, those students moving so
light-hearted amid the dead dragons and satans of an extinct world? Do
they think there are no more dragons to be slain? Know they that
saying, &lsquo;He descended into hell;&rsquo; and that, from Orpheus
and Herakles to Mohammed and Swedenborg, this is the burthen felt by
those who would be saviours of men?</p>
<p>It is not only loving birds that build their nests and rear their
young over the horns of forgotten fears, but, alas! the Harpies too!
These, which Dante saw nestling in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"v2pb455" href="#v2pb455" name="v2pb455">455</a>]</span>still
plants&mdash;once men who had wronged themselves&mdash;rear successors
above the aspirations that have ended in &lsquo;nothing but
leaves.&rsquo; The sculptures of Magdalen are incomplete. There is a
vacant side to the quadrangle, which, it is to be feared, awaits the
truer teaching that would fill it up with the real dragons which no
youth could heedlessly pass. Who can carve there the wrongs that await
their powers of redress? Who can set before them, with all its
baseness, the true emblem of pious fraud? When will they see in any
stone mirror the real shape of a double-tongued Culture&mdash;one fork
intoning litanies, another whispering contempt of them? The werewolves
of scholarly selfishness, the Lamias of christian casuistry, the subtle
intelligence that is fed by sages and heroes, but turns them to dust,
nay, to venom, because it dares not be human, still crawls&mdash;these
are yet to be revealed in all their horrors. Then will the old cry,
<span class="sc">Sursum Corda</span>, sound over the ancient symbols
whereon scholars waste their strength, by which they are conquered; and
wings of courage shall bear them with their arrows of light to rescue
from Superstition the holy places of Humanity.</p>
